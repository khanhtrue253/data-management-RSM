## Description

The folder contains report and accompanying materials for the course Data Management & Ethics at RSM (Master). Using publicly scrapped data, students are required to construct database and perform queries that can answer a question (using only descriptive statistics). In this report, data scraped by Inside Airbnb (a public, social project providing Airbnb listing infos to help residential and community purposes) is used.

For my work, I used the pricing house in Paris to examine average price across potential influencers (area, room type, hosts) and markup behavior.

## Access the files

Description of all files should be clear to indicate which file does what. Notes:

- Download large files first [through this link!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sQzeAEVsVZg3HwIenzaO3bZgjx9tNiDT?usp=sharing)
- Database file is loadable in DB Browser (SQLite). On other platforms, using the raw data + verbal description in part 3 of report should allow replication of processed data.
