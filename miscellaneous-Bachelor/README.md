## Description

This folder contains projects that were done during Bachelor, specifically third year, that is related to Business Analytics. The projects lacks documentation as I was focused on the algorithm, and as such are classified as miscellaneous.

However, the projects offer a good glimpse into clustering skills - which proves useful when exploring new market territories.

  - BI Report: Clustering-then-prediction, for predicting customer intentions.
  - Bachelor Thesis (page 40-43): Grouping survey respondents (which should be representative of the Dutch highly skilled working professionals) into categories to derive insights.
