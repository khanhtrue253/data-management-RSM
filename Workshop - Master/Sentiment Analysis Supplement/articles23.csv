"2023_1";"2023 Will Challenge Wartime Survival Skills of Russian Airlines.txt";"  Russiaâ€™s battered civil aviation sector is emerging from a tumultuous year after the Ukraine war upended normal operations. Moscow is aiming for a 6% uptick in passenger numbers. But that goal may be wishful thinking, given the bleak outlook for Russiaâ€™s economy and the fact that fuel usage by commercial airlines is on the wane. Jet fuel production since the start of December is also down 20% on an annual basis.  Speaking to President Vladimir Putin this week, Transport Minister Vitaly Saveliev said that Russian airlines handled 95 million passengers in 2022. The loss of 16 million passengers versus 2021 rates is largely due to the closure of airports in the south of the country, including Crimea, which shut down at the start of the Ukraine war last February. Russian observers doubt that this yearâ€™s goal of 101 million passengers is achievable amid expectations of further economic weakness for the second year in a row. The continued closure of southern airports and an expected reduction in state subsidies put a further damper on the aviation sector. Collateral Damage Dynamics in the jet fuel market show the extent of collateral damage from the war. Production in December and the first three weeks of January averaged about 200,000 barrels per day, down nearly 20% from 240,000 b/d in 2022. So far in January, deliveries by rail to civil aviation totaled 60,000 b/d, versus 90,000 b/d in January 2022 and an average 80,000 b/d last year. Monopoly pipeline operator Transneft also delivers jet to the sector. These volumes totaling around 35,000 b/d in the December-January period mainly supply Moscowâ€™s three airports. Purchases by â€?federal structuresâ€ â€ a proxy for Russiaâ€™s defense ministry and state reserves agency Rosreserv â€ have not picked up this winter, unlike in previous years when aviation fuel demand receded. Government buying activity amounted to just 30,000 b/d since December, about half the level in 2022. These deliveries peaked at 85,000 b/d in October, when Moscow intensified its military campaign to destroy Ukraineâ€™s energy infrastructure. However Russiaâ€™s jet fuel market is relatively insulated from the imminent EU embargo on Russian petroleum products that will impact its diesel, fuel oil, and naphtha shipments. Russia exported just 40,000 b/d of jet fuel last year, according to Energy Intelligence estimates. Novatekâ€™s condensate splitter on the Gulf of Finland accounted for more than half of those shipments. Shipping data from Kpler show that Russia exported 16,000 b/d by sea in 2022. Several cargoes went to countries including the Netherlands, Finland, and Latvia that can no longer import after Feb. 5. Russia found a new customer last year for its jet exports â€ Turkey. That country was the largest offtaker with imports of 7,000 b/d â€ all from Novatek. Kpler data show that Turkey imported no jet from Russia by sea in 2021. The remainder of Russian fuel exports most likely went to nearby countries like Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia that can take deliveries by rail. Registration Woes Russian air carriers have adapted to wartime realities after nearly one year. The most controversial issue has been the government's move to illegally domicile hundreds of leased jets. The leasing companies dealing with Russia have typically preferred registration in third countries such as Bermuda and Ireland for fear that foreign destinations would question the safety credentials of Boeing and Airbus jets maintained in Russia. But when war broke out last February, Bermuda and Ireland abrogated the registration of these planes, forcing carriers like Aeroflot and S7 to seek domestic certification. Without an official registration, Russian airlines could not fly to foreign destinations that had not banned Russian planes and citizens â€ like the US and EU. In a recent report, Russian daily Kommersant reported that carriers had managed to re-register 200 airplanes in Russia by December, including 150 manufactured by Boeing and Airbus. Russiaâ€™s 114 commercial airlines are fretting about reports of government cutbacks to subsidies. Last year the state disbursed some 172 billion rubles ($2.5 billion), according to industry regulator Rosaviatsia. But this largesse is expected to dry up in 2023 as Moscow prioritizes procurements for the war effort. For now the government has earmarked only 25 billion rubles for civil aviation subsidies until the end of March. The funds will be paid based on a carrierâ€™s total passenger-kilometers in the November 2022-March 2023 period, provided the carrier handled at least 90% of last yearâ€™s average traffic.

"2023_1";"A very challenging global economic outlook.txt";"  One message that is coming out of both the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank is that the world is still to recover in any sustainable way from serious economic challenges. A still-continuing Covid-19 pandemic- although significantly less intense than its variants during the first two years- aggregate supply shock, a fast-unfolding climate change crisis, and lack of any meaningful multilateralism have been some of the main reasons for the delay in both global economic recovery, and putting it on much-needed resilient, inclusive, and sustainable path, especially for those in the global South, who during all this time were denied vaccine justice, a meaningful debt moratorium/relief effort, and any significant level of provision of climate finance. Hence, World Bank in its January 2023 published 'Global Economic Prospects' (GEP) report highlighted the difficult economic outlook for the current year, and the main challenges as 'Global growth is expected to decelerate sharply to 1.7 percent in 2023- the third weakest pace of growth in nearly three decades, overshadowed only by the global recessions caused by the pandemic and the global financial crisis. This is 1.3 percentage points below previous forecasts, reflecting synchronous policy tightening aimed at containing very high inflation, worsening financial conditions, and continued disruptions from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.' In the particular case of Pakistan, economic outlook remains very difficult, with economic growth rate for fiscal year (FY) 2022/23 forecast at only 2 percent, and which becomes only slightly better, as per the forecasted number, in FY2023/24 at 3.2 percent. - Advertisement - Moreover, a recent The Financial Times article 'The threat of a lost decade in development' by Martin Wolf, highlighted the report to be indicative of global economic challenges being particularly worrisome for developing countries, and if not properly dealt with, could mean 'lost decades' for a number of 'vulnerable places. He pointed out in this regard 'The shocks of the past three years have hit all countries, but they have hit emerging and developing countries particularly hard. As a result, according to Global Economic Prospects 2023, just out from the World Bank, the convergence of average incomes between poor and rich countries has stalled. Worse, it might not soon return, given the damage already done and likely to persist in the years ahead. ...An obvious danger now is that of waves of defaults in over-indebted developing countries. Taken together, these shocks will cause long-lasting effects, perhaps lost decades, in many vulnerable places.' Hence, given the gravity of the economic challenges at hand, it is important that a mission-oriented, purpose-driven, effort is launched at the global level that deals with both the neoliberal assault, and climate change crisis, so that the global economy is put on a much-needed strong footing; something that was missing when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Hence, given the gravity of the economic challenges at hand, it is important that a mission-oriented, purpose-driven, effort is launched at the global level that deals with both the neoliberal assault, and climate change crisis, so that the global economy is put on a much-needed strong footing; something that was missing when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. As can be seen from the GEP report, economic growth for most of the countries across the global North and South went into the negative zone in 2020- the year the pandemic was declared- and even after nearly three years into the pandemic, the global economic outlook still remains extremely difficult; not to mention deep weaknesses of global supply chains, deeply ill-prepared public health sectors, and serious lack of climate change related disaster preparedness that the pandemic brought to the fore. Similarly, IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, also raised serious concerns at the global economic outlook, as pointed out by a recent FT published article 'Recession will hit a third of the world this year. IMF chief warns' as follows: 'A third of the global economy will be hit by recession this year, the head of the IMF has said, as she warned that the world faces a 'tougher' year in 2023 than the previous 12 months. The US, EU and China are all slowing simultaneously, said IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva. ...Her comments suggest the IMF is likely to soon cut its economic forecasts for 2023 again; it usually publishes updated projections during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which takes place later this month.' Moreover, noted credit rating agency 'Fitch Solutions' in its November 2022 published article 'Fitch Solutions global macro key themes for 2023' pointed out 'We expect that global real GDP growth will slow from 3.1 percent in 2022 to 2.0 percent in 2023. Other than the pandemic in 2020, this would mark the slowest pace of growth since the Global Financial Crisis. Developed markets will be hit hard, with a painful recession in the eurozone as well as a light and short recession in the US. ...While leading indicators such as commodity prices, shipping rates and inflation expectations all point to weaker price growth, we believe that it will take a while for headline inflation to reach central bank targets. In fact, while inflation will trend lower over 2023, it is unlikely to hit central bank targets over the next nine-to-12 months in most economies. Inflation will remain sticky in those economies that have been hit by large supply shocks...'  Page 2 of 3 A very challenging global economic outlook        "
"2023_1";"Al-Zour Adds to Flood of Kuwaiti Jet Coming to Europe.txt";"  Kuwait is extending its lead as Europeâ€™s top overseas jet fuel supplier with the first production from Kuwait Petroleum Corp.â€™s new 615,000 barrel per day Al-Zour refinery joining an earlier flood of fuel from KPCâ€™s revamped and combined Mina Abdullah and Mina al-Ahmadi plants. Tanker-tracking services show the first jet cargo from Al-Zour arriving in Europe on Dec. 27, when European supermajor Shell discharged the LR2 Al-Bateen carrying 374,300 barrels of jet from Al-Zour and 400,100 bbl from nearby Mina Abdullah into its Shellhaven terminal in the UK. More than 2 million bbl of jet has loaded from Al-Zour since the first shipment in late November.  Fuel has also headed to South Africa and Pakistan as well as to airports in the Gulf. International Energy Agency (IEA) data show Kuwait was already Europeâ€™s largest overseas jet supplier even before Al-Zour came on stream in November. Jet flows reached 100,000 b/d (3.44 million metric tons) in the nine months to end-September last year. Volumes more than doubled after the completion of KPCâ€™s Clean Fuels Project . Kuwaiti jet traffic is now three times what it was before the pandemic, when Kuwait languished in sixth place behind the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, India and even Russia and South Korea in the league table of Europeâ€™s top overseas suppliers. Diesel Distraction Few other countries are anywhere close to their pre-pandemic jet fuel sales to Europe, mostly by design. Market savvy refiners switched to supplying ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) during the pandemic and remain hooked on the record diesel profits seen throughout Europeâ€™s Covid-19 recovery and ahead of the EU's looming Feb. 5 ban on Russian diesel. IEA data show Saudi Arabia, India and the UAE all boosting ULSD sales to Europe at the expense of jet since 2019. UAE jet flows to Europe fell again last year and now stand at just two-fifths of pre-pandemic levels compared to a near tripling of ULSD volumes in the same time. Saudi Arabia is now sending half as much jet to Europe as it did before Covid-19 with Saudi Aramcoâ€™s new 400,000 b/d Jazan refinery set to focus entirely on ULSD once its long-awaited hydrocracker starts up. Europeâ€™s gasoil traders routinely mention Al-Zour in the same breath as Jazan as helping Europe fill the gap left by Russia. Al-Zour has yet to make any European spec ULSD and it is still not clear whether it will have that capability. Longer Supply Chains Elsewhere, Europeâ€™s jet fuel supply chains are getting longer as traders look to refiners in Asia-Pacific to meet recovering airline fuel demand. Jet volumes from China almost tripled last year even before two new refineries â€ the 400,000 b/d Guangdong Petrochemical and 320,000 b/d Shenghong Petrochemical plants â€ started up in the fourth quarter. That was around the same time that Beijing released a round of generous jet fuel export quotas. More Chinese refining capacity is planned for this year, when rampant Covid-19 infections could keep a tight lid on domestic jet demand. China was already Europeâ€™s sixth-biggest overseas jet supplier behind South Korea last year with Singapore and Malaysia also in the top 10. Europeâ€™s jet fuel market is still a fifth smaller than it was before the pandemic: airline fuel demand, refinery production and imports all have the same deficit. IEA data show European jet demand recovering 75% last year to 1.18 million b/d. Local refinery production jumped 77% year on year to 773,000 b/d while total imports rose 46% â€ from a higher base â€ to 416,000 b/d. Jet traffic from Russia has already collapsed even before the EU embargo. Its sales to Europe plunged to barely a third of pre-pandemic levels last year.

"2023_1";"Erste Group - Economic Outlook_ Global economy should find bottom in 2023 - Jan 16, 2023, Global eco.txt";"  Global economy Slight decline in growth momentum expected in 2023 Following a significant slowdown in growth in 2022, the IMF expects a further slight cooling of the global economy's growth momentum in 2023. While growth in the developed economic regions will decline further in 2023, growth in emerging markets should stabilize. Although the outlook is fraught with uncertainty, the first signs of cautious optimism can nevertheless be seen. For example, after a long phase of downturn (1 to 1.5 years), numerous leading indicators in many countries are already close to levels where a bottom was found in previous economic cycles. In addition, there are growing signs of a gradual slowdown in global inflation momentum, which has contributed significantly to the cooling of growth in 2022. Rapidly falling global commodity prices point to continued declining inflation rates in 2023. This should have a supportive effect on the economic outlook for 2023. Falling inflation momentum will strengthen consumers' real income levels again, which should benefit consumption growth. In addition, falling inflation is likely to lead to a tightening of the monetary policy stance by the main central banks. For the time being, this has triggered increased risk appetite among investors on the financial markets; for example, a significant weakening of the US dollar against other major currencies and a falling trend in risk premiums for high-yield bonds. If the increased risk appetite continues in 2023, the global economy will once again have more investment capital at its disposal, which in our view should also lead to a steady improvement in growth prospects. Emerging markets in particular have historically performed better than average in phases of a weak US dollar. *****  Page 2 of 2 Erste Group - Economic Outlook: Global economy should find bottom in 2023 - Jan 16, 2023, Global economy        "
"2023_1";"Erste Group - Economic Outlook_ Global Strategy 1Q 2023 - Jan 9, 2023, Global Economy.txt";"  Global Strategy 1Q 2023 High inflation and increased interest rates should lead to only weak GDP growth. Central banks have not yet completed the cycle of interest rate hikes and geopolitical uncertainty could lead to increased volatility in financial markets for some time. We consider medium and longer maturities of US government bonds in dollars to be attractively valued. In the equity market, we recommend quality stocks with high dividend yields and defensive sectors. In corporate bonds, we prefer the BB segment. Economy Despite high inflation and rising interest rates, private consumption in the US is still robust, which is likely due to the strong labour market. Investment spending and the real estate market, on the other hand, are suffering. We expect only weak GDP growth in the US this year. Easing pressure from energy prices, housing costs and food prices should bring the inflation rate down in the course of the year. The countries of the Eurozone are showing divergent developments. While Italy and Spain are benefiting from the recovery in tourism, Germany is feeling the cooling of the global economy. With an improvement in the global growth environment, investment momentum should be able to pick up from the 2nd half of the year. An important factor for the decline in inflation - and thus the recovery of private consumption - will be the development of energy prices. However, a drop in gas and electricity prices will only reach households and companies with a time lag. Bonds The interest rate hikes in the US are not yet complete, but the FOMC has already slowed down the momentum of the rate steps. We expect two more rate hikes in February and March, but this will depend on the development of inflation and the labour market. The US yield curve remains inverted as the market assumes that the current level of key interest rates will not persist. Declining inflation rates could fuel speculation of rate cuts later in the year, leading to falling yields across all maturities. The ECB has recently held out the prospect of further significant rate hikes. In March, lower energy prices should dampen the ECB's inflation forecasts, but the inflation target is not expected to be reached until 2025. A sufficiently restrictive interest rate level could be reached in May and yields on longer maturities could fall. Currencies Despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, the outlook for the economy and inflation should ease. Therefore, safe haven currencies should gradually lose their attractiveness. We expect a slight weakening of the Swiss franc against the euro. The latter should strengthen slightly against the US dollar as interest rate differentials narrow. The gold price is supported by negative real yields. Shares The global dividend yield in 2023 is below the level of increased US government bond yields, which currently limits the relative attractiveness of equities. We expect only a moderate increase in the global equity market in 1Q and prefer defensive sectors and quality stocks with high dividend yields  Page 2 of 3 Erste Group - Economic Outlook: Global Strategy 1Q 2023 - Jan 9, 2023, Global Economy        "
"2023_1";"China's Emergence From Lockdown Drives Oil Prices Higher.txt";"  Oil prices leapt $5 per barrel as the speed of China's reopening and its sudden desperate thirst for oil took the market by surprise. â€?We expected Chinese crude demand to grow by about 900,000 barrels per day this year, but Chinese refiners are telling us the number could be as much as 2 million b/d,â€ flagged Energy Aspects chief oil analyst Amrita Sen at a Mideast conference this week. â€?We are already starting to see green shoots with regards to demand for gasoline and jet,â€ Sen added. China reopened its international borders for the first time in three years last weekend, not long after Beijing suddenly abandoned its long-standing ""zero-Covid"" policy. Speaking at the same conference, Vitol's head of Asian trading Mike Muller admitted the market had not been ready for China's sudden return.  Crude oil prices are now expected to go above $100/bbl this year. Falling inflation in the US is also likely to herald a softer dollar that could help cut fuel prices and revive oil demand elsewhere. US annualized inflation has slowed to a 14-month low of 6.5%, according to new figures out Jan. 12, with falling gasoline prices playing a key role. International benchmark Brent finished the week up $5.34/bbl at $84.03/bbl Thursday, while US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate gained $4.72/bbl to close at $78.39/bbl. US bank Morgan Stanley this week suggested Brent could near $110/bbl in the second half of 2023. Russian crude is still mostly flowing despite the EUâ€™s December ban on seaborne imports and the G7â€™s price cap. India and China are proving eager buyers. The same restrictions on Russian refined products from next month could be far more disruptive. The lack of alternative buyers for Russian diesel is likely to tighten an already-pinched global distillate market, as Russia cuts production and Europe casts its net wider for alternative fuel sources. Formal G7 discussions on Russian product prices, and a possible revision to the crude price cap, have just been scheduled for Jan. 18 and Jan. 25. Europeâ€™s ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures also saw big gains ahead of the January contractâ€™s expiry. Jet spot trade has already moved onto February with jet fuel cargoes now pegged at a $91 per metric ton premium to the screen, up from around $70/ton a week ago. Traders are increasingly concerned that the rush to send ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) to Europe in place of Russia will be at the expense of jet fuel. Arrivals are pegged at 1.5 million tons in January, slightly below recent months. Most Mideast and Asian export refiners switched to maximum diesel yields during the pandemic and now have little incentive to switch back. The pressure comes as Europeâ€™s airline fuel demand is set to return to its pre-pandemic growth track this summer. Kuwait has emerged as Europe's biggest overseas jet supplier since a shortage of desulfurization capacity prevents it from making ULSD. That will change when Kuwait Petroleum Corp.'s new 615,000 b/d Al-Zour refinery reaches full production. But traders reported teething troubles with the first of three crude units this week. A steady flow of jet cargo deals saw European major BP buy three cargo lots: two from Chinaâ€™s Unipec and one from Vitol â€ into Rotterdam, the UKâ€™s Isle of Grain and Le Havre. French oil company TotalEnergies bought a fourth from Vitol into Le Havre. All deals were done at double-digit premiums to floating Platts prices. Vitol nominated the STI Connaught bringing jet from both Malaysia and India, and the Elandra Sound holding fuel from both Qatar and Kuwait in its deals. Tankers typically carry single-origin fuel â€ although Vitol insisted the multiport loadings were usual. Jet fuel tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp rose slightly to 864,000 tons on Jan. 12, according to Insights Global, after an import tanker arrived from China. Parallel gasoil tanks are at 14-month highs of 2.083 million tons amid long-haul imports from China and Singapore as well as nearby Russia. US jet fuel markets have taken a steady upward climb since late last year on the back of stronger basis diesel futures. But they also have momentum of their own from lower US output following severe winter weather that disrupted refinery operations. Jet spreads have jumped from negative values at year's end to reach positive ground. New York Harbor jet is by far the strongest, reaching $1 per gallon on Thursday â€ up from a 12Â? discount in late December. Prompt supplies are scarce in the wake of a 700,000 barrel drop in East Coast jet stocks in the week ended Jan. 6. On the Gulf Coast, spreads have climbed to 40Â?/gallon over the February print from discounts of 19Â? late last year. Differentials in Los Angeles were assessed at 14Â?/gallon over Nymex diesel futures, down from last week's 40Â? premium as massive flooding disrupted flights across California. Asian jet markets weakened further and chose to ignore China's re-emergence and the approach of its New Year holiday, which is expected to unleash a torrent of pent-up travel demand. Benchmark Singapore spot price differentials at one point dropped to a month-long low. The decline occurred despite significant arbitrage flows of jet out of the region to the US and West of Suez. Singapore differentials slumped to a premium of $1.63/bbl to Singapore quotes on Jan. 11, their lowest level since Dec. 13. It subsequently recovered slightly to a $1.66/bbl premium on Jan.12 â€ a drop of 38Â?/bbl from last week. A total of 2.6 million bbl of arbitrage jet has loaded or is scheduled to load from Jan. 11-24 from South Korea, China and India, according to Kpler data. The volume is expected to arrive from Feb. 7 to Mar. 8 in the US, Portugal and a destination west of the Suez canal. On top of that, another 355,000 bbl of arbitrage jet is loading on Jan. 15 from Qatar and is headed for a Feb. 10 arrival in Europe, according to Kpler. Further out, 1.54 million bbl of arbitrage jet is scheduled to load from Feb. 12-25 from Korea and is all expected to head to the US. Arrival dates range from Mar. 6-31, according to Kpler data. In addition, 344,000 bbl of arbitrage jet is due to load on Feb. 3 from Saudi Arabia and scheduled to head to Germany for arrival on Mar. 11.

"2023_1";"China and Jet Fuel Drive Oil Price Gains.txt";"  Oil prices continued to climb after Chinaâ€™s sudden reopening reignited buying. Macro-economic discussions have switched from recession to growth thanks to Beijingâ€™s surprise change of tack on Covid-19. The International Monetary Fund shared an outlook for economic improvement from the second half of 2023 though next year at the Davos economic forum in Switzerland this week. International benchmark Brent gained $2.18 per barrel over the week to finish at $86.16/bbl Thursday while US price-pin WTI put on $1.94/bbl to close at $80.33/bbl. Jet fuel will account for almost half of all oil demand growth this year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The Westâ€™s energy watchdog now sees global jet demand up 850,000 barrels per day this year out of a total 1.9 million b/d increase in fuel â€?against a backdrop of lower prices, a somewhat improved economic outlook and a faster than anticipated reopening of China.â€ Its latest forecast has global jet demand at an average 6.9 million b/d this year, still below the just under 8 million b/d seen pre-pandemic, and against total oil demand at a new all-time high of 101.7 million b/d. Gains in Europeâ€™s benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures outstripped those in Brent by almost two-to-one.  Traders are increasingly nervous about the impact of the EUâ€™s ban on Russian product imports from Feb. 5. Early efforts to replace Russian diesel while Baltic fuel is still flowing have left Europe inundated with imports and tanks rising. Gasoil stocks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hit a 16-month high of 2.2 million metric tons this week, according to Insights Global. But itâ€™s still hard to see how import-dependent Europe will manage after the ban. The expected rerouting of global diesel flows depends on having enough clean shipping to carry fuel much longer distances. It also requires Russia to keep on pumping out the same volume of ULSD after its target export market has disappeared. Europe's jet traders worry that East of Suez refiners will focus on making diesel at the expense of jet, just as airline buying starts to get back to pre-pandemic levels. Front-month cargo swaps have jumped from $79.50 per ton over LSGO futures to $92/ton in the last week amid fears of shortages. Air traffic is still 15% below 2019 levels, according to the latest Eurocontrol figures, but poised for recovery. Four jet fuel cargoes changed hands in Europeâ€™s end-of-day pricing window this week. Swiss trader Glencore sold 30,000 tons to European heavyweight BP into Le Havre Feb. 3-7 at a $85/ton premium to front-month LSGO futures last Friday. Glencore went on to buy twice from Chinaâ€™s Unipec into Rotterdam Jan. 31-Feb. 4 on Monday, at a $25/ton and $28/ton premium to the Plattsâ€™ c.i.f cargo mean (CCM) pricing Feb. 10-28. BP also bought again from Unipec on Tuesday, paying CCM plus $29/ton with prices again averaged over Feb. 10-28. US jet fuel markets are still under-supplied despite a rebound in stock levels from historic lows in early January. Soaring jet spreads in all of the major trading regions are the tell-tale sign of shortages. New York Harbor markets are screaming for imports, with jet spreads spiking to $1 per gallon over February diesel futures. That's up from a 5Â? discount in late December. Gulf Coast barrels were assessed at 42Â?/gallon over the prompt Nymex contract, versus 30Â? last week and parity with diesel futures as 2022 came to a close. In a rare inversion of normal pricing patterns, differentials in Los Angeles are among the lowest in the US at 30Â?/gallon above the February contract, a steep rise from their 13Â? premium last week. China's reopening spurred fresh gains in Asia's jet market, as did a fresh exodus of tankers to markets West of Suez. Data firm Kayrros flagged a doubling of Chinese jet demand â€?almost overnightâ€ in a report last week, after Beijing changed its Covid-19 policy. China's purchases nudged 450,000 b/d in early January, up from barely 230,000 b/d at the end of December. That is still below the 550,000 b/d-plus seen last summer with most airline buying still for domestic flights in the run-up to the Chinese Lunar New Year. High Covid-19 infection rates in China mean many countries are imposing restrictions on Chinese international arrivals. The benchmark Singapore spot price differential rose by another 6Â?/bbl this week, reaching a hefty $1.72/bbl premium over Singapore quotes by Jan. 19. A massive 3.05 million bbl of jet fuel will load from South Korea, India and China between Jan. 19-28 for arrival in the US, Europe and Mexico by mid-March, according to data intelligence company Kpler. Volumes are alongside 700,000 bbl loading in the Mideast Gulf from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the same period, destined for Europe and Africa. Scheduled air traffic fell 1.1% on the week in Northeast Asia and 0.5% in the Middle East but grew 2.6% in Southeast Asia and 0.6% in South Asia, according to OAG.

"2023_1";"Jet Cracks Soar in Tight US Market.txt";"  Jet fuel cracks are leading refinery margins higher in several regions including the US Gulf Coast. Energy Intelligenceâ€™s downstream model shows a complex Padd 3 refiner can expect to fetch a jet crack of a staggering $74.53 per barrel against incremental medium, sour crude, outdoing all other products. In Singapore, jet cracks against incremental Omani crude also lead the pack at over $34/bbl.  Jetâ€™s current strength relative to other fuels â€ especially diesel in the US â€ likely reflects acute developments, market players say. But there are more structural elements at play as well that could support jet fuel cracks throughout the year, helping to revive the fortunes of one of the products most heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Storming Up One major element informing jetâ€™s current crack spread is weather, according to independent refiner and industry bellwether Valero Energy. Recent severe storms shuttered significant portions of the US downstream, particularly along the Gulf Coast, where utilization hit a trough of 77.7% at the end of 2022, data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) show. â€?It's still a bit of an overhang from the winter storm outages that we had in the US Gulf Coast, causing [New York and Florida] markets to be exceptionally tight,â€ said Valero Chief Commercial Officer Gary Simmons during the company's recent earnings call. In addition, the Colonial Pipeline system experienced a brief outage in early December that prompted the shutdown of Line 3, which brings fuel to the US Northeast. The storm-related outages exacerbated a slew of hiccups as well as a major rationalization of downstream capacity that began in mid-2019. In addition, refiners saw little reason to produce jet during the pandemic due to travel restrictions. Jet cracks swooned relative to other fuels and significant tightness in diesel attracted jet components into the diesel pool. In Demand Valero predicted that regional jet markets would find some relief in the near term. But restocking faces two challenges. For one thing, refinery maintenance is likely to be heavy this spring , limiting throughputs. For another, consumption is staging a comeback. â€?Overall we expect jet demand to increase significantly this year,â€ said Simmons. That is in part the result of ongoing demand recovery from the pandemic, but also reflects recent developments in China, which is turning away from its zero-Covid-19 policies. â€?Our data shows [jet demand] is now up by more than 20% year on year. Thatâ€™s a staggering jump. It will have an impact on the entire global oil market,â€ said Antoine Rostand, president of climate technology firm Kayross. â€?Weâ€™re beginning to see the wider consequences of Chinaâ€™s reopening.â€ Chinaâ€™s refineries are boosting throughputs and, for now, exporting considerable volumes of refined products, and the Asia-Pacific and Mideast are set to add refining capacity as well. However, Valero noted that some new refining capacity yields smaller-than-usual volumes of transportation fuel, including jet. â€?Some of the big refineries in China, it's less than 50% total gasoline, jet and diesel yield, a lot more petrochemicals and fuel oil production,â€ Simmons said. And as Chinaâ€™s demand grows, exports could dip. Frans Koster  Page 2 of 2 Jet Cracks Soar in Tight US Market        "
"2023_1";"New Restrictions on Russia Threaten to Disrupt Jet Markets.txt";" Jet fuel traders are braced for market turbulence next month when new restrictions on the movement of Russian diesel exports come into force. The European Union is set to ban all fuel imports from Russia from Feb. 5, when the G7 also plans to set maximum prices for Russian products going elsewhere. â€?The reconfiguration of global trade implicit in [the] oil products ban is going to be significantly more complex than what weâ€™ve seen already on the crude side,â€? the International Energy Agencyâ€™s (IEA) chief economist Tim Gould warned this week.  Europe currently takes almost all of Russiaâ€™s mainstay diesel exports , whereas Russia's fuel oil and naphtha exports already go mainly to Asia. Diesel displaced from Europe could struggle to find new homes. â€?China and India are [already] both important products exporters, so youâ€™re not going to have the same â€¦ safety valve for oil products as you do for crude,â€ he added. The EUâ€™s earlier Dec. 5 ban on seaborne Russian crude imports and G7 cap at $60 per barrel passed largely without incident. Most market watchers expect Russian diesel to start flowing to Latin America and Africa, freeing up supplies from the US and Mideast Gulf to come to Europe. â€?None of that is simple. There are quality specification issues. There are all sorts of tanker and storage issues that could make that very complicated. So we need to be very watchful of how that plays out in February and beyond,â€ says Gould. Products are less fungible than crude, with buying patterns that are more fragmented. Each region has different fuel specifications, which are rarely interchangeable without expensive blending or reprocessing. Any drop in Russian diesel exports, if Moscow struggles to find new export markets, would tighten already-pinched global diesel balances. The need to transport fuel longer distances will also drive up shipping costs â€ with clean tanker rates expected to double this year. Some traders are suggesting Russian diesel could itself be blended or modified in some way outside of the EU and then sent back as certified non-Russian fuel. Turkey is already taking vast amounts of Russian ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) into storage, while Mideast and Indian refineries may have spare capacity and tanks. The EU has yet to set out what will be allowed. But traders are adept at finding loopholes. To offset the loss of Russian supplies, Europe is relying on its existing ULSD suppliers in the US, Mideast Gulf and Asia to ramp up sales to Europe. Two new Mideast refineries are coming on stream at the perfect time. Saudi Aramcoâ€™s 400,000 barrel per day Jizan plant sent its first ULSD tanker to Europe this week. Kuwait Petroleum Corp. is already arranging term sales from its giant 615,000 b/d Al-Zour . But most East of Suez producers will only be able to boost diesel production by sacrificing jet fuel output. Russia may not export much jet fuel itself, but its impact on jet markets could still be huge. The disruptions come as global aviation struggles to make a full Covid-19 recovery. Jet margins held above diesel for the first time in almost three years last month, finally sending a signal to refiners to boost jet yields. Calm Before The Storm Brokers reported surprisingly little spot market concern about the EUâ€™s looming ban on Russian diesel imports this week. Nor did they mention G7 plans to cap prices, despite the imminent threat. Efforts to replace Russian ULSD have left Europe inundated with tankers from the US, India, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and even China alongside continuing Russian traffic. More Russian diesel is heading to Turkey and Morocco. So far only occasional shipments have gone to Brazil and West Africa. European benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures are down almost 10% so far this year with cargo premiums also crumbling. French major TotalEnergies sold guaranteed non-Russian ULSD to Swiss trader Trafigura into the northern French port of Brest this week at only a $21 per metric ton premium to January LSGO. Premiums are down from over $60/ton in November. G7 Plans Still Unknown Officials plan to set just two price caps for Russian products: one at a premium to crude to cover diesel exports as well as any jet fuel or gasoline sales; and another at a discount which would apply to fuel oil, naphtha and vacuum gasoil sales. Negotiations have yet to even start. Politicians are more focused on a revision of the crude price cap and reluctant to get bogged down in the detail of much more complex refined fuel markets. Regional pricing benchmarks for multiple grades of fuel are assessed daily by price reporting agencies. Premiums or discounts are then agreed against those floating indexes with terms often varying as fuel changes hands multiple times along the supply chain. Initial purchases are often on a free-on-board basis, while later deals normally include cost, insurance and freight, or cost and freight. Market sources insist it would be hard for most buyers to know in advance if they had complied with any G7 cap and to disentangle any transport and other trading costs. Spot traders can use average prices over just a few days around tanker loading or discharge. Big buyers like airlines and fuel retailers often use average month contract pricing. Unlike sanctions, the price cap is not aimed at throttling flows but only intended to limit Moscow's oil revenues. Compliance with the cap provides access to international tanker and insurance markets based in Europe and the US. Non-European traders are using a shadow fleet of older crude tankers to bypass the G7 cap on crude. But the risk of contamination makes an unofficial fleet far less likely for clean products.

"2023_1";"UN forecasts global economic downturn by 2023.txt";"  UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations predicted that global economic growth will fall significantly to 1.9% this year as a result of the food and energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, the continuing impact of the covid-19 pandemic, persistently high inflation and the climate emergency. Portraying a bleak and uncertain economic outlook, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs stated that the current global economic slowdown ""affects both developed and developing countries, with many of them at risk of sliding into recession by 2023."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in the foreword to the 178-page report that ""a widespread and severe slowdown in the global economy is looming amid high inflation, aggressive monetary tightening and rising uncertainty."" According to the report, the economic growth forecast of 1.9% for this year-as opposed to the 3% estimated for 2022-is one of the lowest growth rates in decades. However, a moderate rebound to 2.7% in 2024 is forecast if inflation gradually eases and headwinds begin to abate. In its annual report earlier this month, the World Bank, which lends money to poorer countries for development projects, cut its growth forecast nearly in half, from its previous projection of 3% to just 1.7%. The International Monetary Fund, which lends to countries in need, forecast in October that global growth would slow from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and 2.7% in 2023. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos that 2023 will be a difficult year, but she stood by the projection and said ""we do not expect a global recession."" According to the UN report, this year ""growth momentum has weakened in the United States, the European Union and other developed economies, adversely affecting the rest of the global economy.""

"2023_2";"A resilient global economy.txt";"   Since January 1, the market consensus has upgraded the growth forecasts for the main developed economies by 0.3 points. Thus, the GDP of the G20 countries will increase by 2.1% compared to the previous estimate of 1.8%. This improvement is particularly noteworthy because it comes despite the fact that analysts are already expecting central banks to be more aggressive in their fight against inflation. Specifically, the market expects the Fed to raise rates to 5.5%, half a point higher than expected a month ago. Likewise, the estimate for Europe is that they will climb to 3.5%. The mere fact that the economic outlook is improving despite the higher cost of financing and the slowdown in activity implied by the rate hikes reflects the strength of the global economy. Moreover, analysts are clear that China's awakening after the end of the zero Covid policy will provide the necessary impetus to boost growth even though inflation is still far from the 2% target, which central banks are keeping an eye on. However, it should not be ruled out that these optimistic forecasts will be derailed, especially in the second half of the year. Firstly, because China's recovery is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it helps global GDP and improves supply chains. But it also increases demand, especially in the energy sector, which has been the key to the inflationary spiral, which could push prices higher than estimated. In addition, the black swan of the continuing war in Ukraine and its geopolitical and economic impact should not be forgotten. These factors invite us to be cautious with the current optimism, as they could cast doubt on global economic growth.  Page 2 of 2 A resilient global economy        "

"2023_2";"Data Doubts Trigger Price Revival.txt";" Large adjustments in US official crude stock data stoked trader anxiety Thursday after a week of ample supplies saw Brent futures drift down toward a three-week low of $80 per barrel. Steep April refinery maintenance is starting to dent demand for crude at a time when the G7 price cap scheme and Russiaâ€™s workarounds seem to be keeping Russian crude flowing. US crude stocks were reported to have fallen 7.6 million barrels in the most recent week to Feb. 17, but a revision of the previous weekâ€™s figures saw tanks actually rise by 7 million bbl.  A huge 16 million bbl increase the previous week was revised to just a 2 million bbl build. Brent finished at $82.21/bbl Thursday, down $2.93/bbl on the week, but up from an intra-day low of $80.40/bbl. US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate shed $3.10/bbl to finish at $78.49/bbl. Diesel prices drew no such support with ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) and Nymex diesel futures both falling close to prewar lows ahead of the first anniversary of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. Alternative ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) flows from the US and East of Suez are proving more than enough for Europe after its Feb. 5 ban on Russian fuel imports, given the regionâ€™s large stock cushion, with cargo premiums to the screen also falling by $2 per ton over the week to $12.75/ton Thursday. Gasoil tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hit a 24-month high of almost 2.6 million metric tons Feb. 23, according to Insights Global, after tankers arrived from China, India, Malaysia, Oman and Qatar. Lower natural gas prices are also prompting fuel switching away from diesel in Europe. Russian ULSD is still flowing under the G7â€™s $100/bbl cap albeit less than before the embargo. Market prices are closer to $70/bbl f.o.b. Primorsk, with steep discounts needed to cover expensive freight as Russian tankers are forced farther afield. European jet fuel cargo premiums were barely changed at $54.75/ton over front-month ICE LSGO futures at Thursdayâ€™s close, versus $53.25/ton a week ago. No cargoes traded in the end-of-day pricing window for the third week in a row, with even reduced East of Suez imports more than enough to meet out-of-season airline demand. Into-wing giants BP and Shell are dominating the sell side against sporadic buying from opportunistic traders looking for steep discounts. Shellâ€™s 400,000 barrel per day Pernis in Rotterdam will go into a major turnaround next month with Europeâ€™s largest refinery expected to be out of action until May. Jet tanks in ARA fell to a 34-month low of 709,000 tons Feb. 23, according to Insights Global after no import tankers arrived, but volume left for the UK. Jet fuel sentiment has been bolstered by Chinaâ€™s return to global aviation and the prospect of a full recovery in air traffic to pre-Covid-19 levels. But Europe isn't quite there yet with departures still 13% below 2019 levels this week, according to network manager Eurocontrol and fuel-hungry long-haul routes to China still missing from lighter winter schedules. Market watchers still fear efforts by East of Suez refiners to replace Russian diesel in Europe will be at the expense of jet. Jet profits are already vanishing: Having hit a nine-month high of $7.50/bbl over diesel earlier this month, jet is now valued barely $1/bbl above the road fuel. US jet fuel markets are normalizing after a hectic start to the year. Energy Intelligenceâ€™s downstream model shows crack spreads for jet against incremental medium, sour crude in a complex Gulf Coast refinery dipping back below diesel cracks this week. Latest data from the US Department of Energy show jet tanks building 800,000 bbl in the week to Feb. 17 to 37.3 million bbl, just slightly below year-earlier levels. Jet has shaken off the impacts of severe winter weather late in 2022, when freezing temperatures shuttered a significant swath of downstream capacity and prevented inventories from building in key markets such as New York and Florida. But US jet supply continues to face hurdles. Not only is diesel now outperforming the fuel, and likely attracting components away from the jet pool, the entire US refining complex is entering seasonal maintenance. Refiners and market watchers expect turnarounds to be heavy in the first half of 2023 after maintenance was delayed last year and utilization ramped up to cash in on sky-high refining margins. As much as 1.4 million b/d of US refining capacity could be taken off line in the coming months. There will be some reprieve on the US Gulf Coast where Exxon Mobilâ€™s 250,000 b/d Beaumont, Texas, expansion ramps up later this month. Asia's jet differentials hit a four-month low as dwindling air traffic hit the region's fuel demand. The benchmark Singapore spot price differential was pegged at just a 95Â?/bbl premium to mean of Platts Singapore (Mops) quotes on Feb. 23, down 65Â?/bbl on the week and its lowest level since Oct. 17. A deal in Platts' pricing window confirmed the drop. Saudi Aramco Trading sold 100,000 bbl of mid-March-loading jet to Swiss trader Vitol Feb. 22 at Mops plus 80Â?/bbl. Scheduled airline capacity dipped 0.7% in Northeast Asia for the week of Feb. 20, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. The drop in Asia's largest air market swamped a 0.8% increase in traffic in the Middle East. OAG data showed scheduled airline capacity unchanged in Southeast Asia and South Asia.

"2023_2";"Global economy 'may have hit turning point'.txt";" Central bank efforts to curb high and rising inflation are paying off and the global economy may have reached a turning point, the International Monetary Fund says. This year, the global economy is forecast to expand 2.9 per cent - revised higher from a 2.7 per cent October estimate - and 3.1 per cent in 2024 as China and other emerging economies lead the charge, the fund's updated 2023 economic outlook said. A better-than-expected start to the year is driving a rebound in global stock markets. The S&P/ASX 200 has climbed 7.7 per cent since January 1, the US tech-heavy Nasdaq index is up 9.6 per cent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has firmed 1.8 per cent, Bloomberg data shows. Driving the optimism are signs that the inflationary wave that washed over the world last year has peaked and is now receding, though the effects of rate rises were unlikely to be fully realised until 2024, the IMF said. The global push to raise rates and curb inflation still weighs heavily on national economies. Projected growth of just under 3 per cent this year is down from 3.4 per cent in 2022, and well below the historical average of 3.8 per cent. ""Growth will remain weak by historical standards, as the fight against inflation and Russia's war in Ukraine weigh on activity,"" said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF director of research and economic counsellor. ""Despite these headwinds, the outlook is less gloomy than in our October forecast, and could represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining."" But with central banks likely to further raise rates to keep inflation at bay, restrictive monetary policies in advanced economies had increased the risk that they might tip into recession, the IMF said. Countering that, however, slowing demand and receding inflation in some economies, including the US, raised expectations that the monetary policy tightening would soon end. Treasurer Jim Chalmers played down the revised IMF forecasts, saying the global economy was still ""on a dark and difficult path"". ""While the slight upgrades to global growth are welcome, the IMF is still predicting the weakest two-year period for the global economy - aside from the downturns caused by the GFC and pandemic - in a generation,"" he said. The treasurer said the outlook was still shaped by the energy havoc caused by Russia's war on Ukraine, interest rate rises, the fate of major economies in the northern hemisphere, and China's COVID-19 response. ""And here in Australia, this summer has shown once again natural disasters are an ever-present danger to our communities and our economy."" Mr Gourinchas said the balance of risk was tilted to the downside but had moderated since last October, and the narrow path to a soft landing for the global economy was clearer. ""On the upside, a stronger boost from pent-up demand in numerous economies or a faster fall in inflation are plausible,"" he said. ""On the downside, severe health outcomes in China could hold back the recovery, Russia's war in Ukraine could escalate, and tighter global financing conditions could worsen debt distress. ""Financial markets could also suddenly reprice in response to adverse inflation news, while further geopolitical fragmentation could hamper economic progress."" The IMF said with many countries, including Australia, facing a cost-of-living crisis, further fiscal support in a targeted fashion was needed, but it said broad-based fiscal relief had to be withdrawn. Dr Chalmers said his second budget in May would provide responsible cost-of-living relief that would not add to inflationary pressure.

Many countries are struggling with inflation, interest rates, food and energy prices, climate change, reduced growth, and recession. As prices rise, global central banks tighten monetary policy. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) MD Kristalina Georgieva, global inflation is slowing in several nations. Georgieva feels the global economy remains under strain. The global economy remains unstable. 'Global growth may flip in 2023,' Georgieva said. The IMF director said government must prioritise resilience at all levels to better withstand shocks. Also Read: Amid Pakistan crisis, IMF says China must modify debt strategy as low-income states cannot pay After an 8.8% increase in 2022, the fund estimated in January that global consumer price hikes would slow to 6.6% in 2023, 0.1 percentage point higher than the October forecast. It forecast a 4.3% slowing in 2024. In 2023, 84% of countries expect lower inflation than in 2022. For the first time in a year, the IMF raised its global economic growth projection, citing strong US consumer spending and China's reopening. 'We see inflation finally cutting down in quite a few nations,' Georgieva remarked on February 14. 'The potential of eventually getting on top of cost of living being a significant disrupter for millions and millions of people, we see light at the end of this tunnel.'

Despite this year's slower growth than 2022's 3.4%, the IMF forecast that growth will level off before rising to 3.1% in 2024. Georgieva added that, while global economic growth is peaking, the fund's biggest concerns—including the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's conflict in Ukraine, and the Turkey-Syria earthquake—remain.

"2023_2";"PH Hession Enterprise - Global Economic Outlook Improves.txt";" Asian-based investment house PH Hession Enterprise have released a report showing that the prospects for the global economy this year and next may be less bad than initially feared.  The report warned that while the global economic outlook will be plagued by high inflation and less than optimal growth in 2023, it will likely fare better than initially anticipated.  Other factors contributing to the troubled economic outlook are the fallout of the war in Ukraine, soaring interest rates and spiking prices.  The report went on to note that fears that natural gas supplies would be constrained in Europe due to the conflict in Ukraine had so far appeared to be unfounded. However, the higher energy prices seen in 2022 will continue to affect inflation rates this year.  Analysts at PH Hession Enterprise believe that although inflation will remain high in most developed economies, it is beginning to fall and should continue to do so in 2023.  The more optimistic outlook can be attributed largely to the reopening of China's economy after it abandoned its harsh zero-COVID policy.  ""While China's recovery from COVID disruptions remains fragile, the reopening of its economy will certainly spur global growth and this is much needed,"" said Mr. Chin-Lung Toh, CFO at PH Hession Enterprise.  PH Hession analysts believe the global economy will expand by 3% this year. This is an increase of 0.2% on their earlier predictions.

"2023_2";"Prices Steady as Global Diesel Flows Reroute.txt";"  Oil prices were barely changed on the week with the market so far managing the EUâ€™s ban on Russian fuel imports and G7 price caps on Moscowâ€™s diesel and fuel oil sales elsewhere. International benchmark Brent edged 64Â? per barrel higher to close at $85.14/bbl Thursday, while US price-pin West Texas Intermediate gained only 43Â?/bbl to end the week at $78.49/bbl. Russia will cut crude exports by 500,000 barrels per day from next month, but is still pumping out large amounts of diesel to new markets in Africa and the Middle East. Europe is so far coping with a cushion from high diesel stocks and more imports, especially from East of Suez. But the International Energy Agency (IEA) has issued a fresh warning that the market will struggle to cope without Russian diesel if exports are seriously disrupted.  ""The market could accommodate a 50% cut in Russian gasoil exports, but not a complete rupture due to global refinery capacity limits,"" the agency said in its latest monthly Oil Market Report . ""Russian exports play a crucial role in balancing world product markets, particularly gasoil, and Europe has, up until now, always been central to its trade flows,"" the agency noted. Energy Intelligence's base-case forecast currently sees Russian diesel exports falling by up to 300,000 b/d this year, while it expects new refining capacity to come on line late in the year. Recovering jet fuel demand post-Covid-19 is the other big potential market mover with Chinaâ€™s reopening threatening to jeopardize much-needed diesel exports. The IEA has suggested Beijing's stance on domestic refinery activity and product exports will be a key factor in maintaining diesel market equilibrium this year. But refiners can only maximize production of diesel or jet at the expense of the other and Beijing has already made it clear it will prioritize domestic buying. The IEA sees jet demand rising 1.1 million b/d to 7.2 million b/d in 2023, accounting for more than half of this yearâ€™s 2 million b/d jump in global oil demand to 101.9 million b/d. Europeâ€™s benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures edged $6 per metric ton higher to $820/ton at Thursdayâ€™s close. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel cargo premiums firmed from $10.25/ton to $14.75/ton on top, with jet cargo premiums dropping from $79/ton last week to just $53.25/ton Thursday. Softer jet comes as the regionâ€™s air traffic remains stubbornly 11% below pre-pandemic levels over the normally busy February school holiday. Nothing traded in the end-of-day jet cargo pricing window for the second week in a row. Into-wing heavyweights BP and Shell have both turned into sellers in a sign that airline buying has not taken off as expected. BP named the LR2 STI Orchard bringing jet from Kuwaitâ€™s Mina Abdullah and LR1 Portofino bringing fuel from Indiaâ€™s Jamnagar. Closely watched jet fuel tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) are at their lowest in almost three years after falling to 747,000 tons on Feb. 16, according to data from Insights Global. No jet import tankers arrived this week while volumes left ARA for the UK and Ireland as well as into the local barge market. Local gasoil tanks meanwhile hit a two-year high of over 2.5 million tons Feb. 16. Insights Global flagged ARA diesel imports from China, South Korea, Singapore, India, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Europeâ€™s diesel supply chains are lengthening as the market scrambles to replace short-haul Russian fuel. US jet markets took a tumble as much lower jet spreads combined with weaker basis diesel futures. The March Nymex contract lost another 3.5Â? per gallon on Thursday to close at $2.81, putting outright quotes in the $2.62-$2.87/gallon range or a whopping 45Â? below 30-day averages. The East Coast saw the biggest drop as a flurry of imported cargoes swelled regional stockpiles by more than 2 million barrels. Tanks in Padd 1 had been unusually lean for a long period, averaging well below the five-year trend. After jumping by more than 30% to 9.6 million bbl in the week ended Feb. 10, they are now 13% ahead of the year-ago mark. An unusually heavy refinery maintenance season clipped utilization rates to 86.5% of capacity. The Gulf Coast accounted for most of the drop in US output to 1.52 million b/d with regional output falling by 73,000 b/d to just 825,000 b/d. Lower production reduced Gulf Coast tank levels by 1.6 million bbl. But that was more than offset by the huge surge on the East Coast, putting overall stocks at 36.5 million bbl. Demand dipped by 100,000 b/d to 1.4 million b/d after averaging above 1.5 million b/d over the last two months. Asia's jet market weakened with bumper fuel exports failing to offset local demand losses from flagging air traffic. Benchmark Singapore spot price differentials hit a two-month low of $1.44/bbl on Feb. 13 before recovering slightly to $1.60/bbl by Thursday's close. That still represents a significant $1.37/bbl drop from the $2.97/bbl premium seen a week ago. Scheduled airline capacity shrank by 1.6% in Northeast Asia and by 0.5% in Southeast Asia this week, according to OAG. A gain of 1.3% in South Asia was not enough to tip the balance of regional demand. A bumper 5.27 million bbl of arbitrage jet is scheduled to load from South Korea, China, India and Japan in the second half of February, according to data intelligence company Kpler, which is already flagging another 3.25 million bbl loading in March. Volumes are heading to Europe and West of Suez in general, as well as across the Pacific to the US. Mideast volumes are pointed at East Africa as well as Europe. More than 1 million bbl is still due to load in Saudi Arabia before the end of this month, according to Kpler, with other Mideast producers also ramping up volumes.

"2023_2";"Refining_ Refiners Need to Run Hard to Keep People Flying.txt";"  The middle distillate market is expected to be tight again in 2023. This year it will be rising jet fuel demand putting pressure on prices; in 2022 it was rising diesel demand. Both jet fuel and diesel are competing for similar molecules from the refining process. With the impact of the pandemic waning, jet fuel consumption is set to grow 720,000 barrels per day in 2023, while demand for diesel might decline by 100,000 b/d, Energy Intelligence balances show. Additional refining capacity coming on line would fall just short of satisfying rising middle distillate demand. Rising demand for diesel/kerosene/gasoil and jet fuel combined this year is seen at 620,000 b/d. An analysis of new refining capacity coming on line shows that refineries will have trouble keeping up.  They could add 550,000 b/d in middle distillate production, the Future of Fuels study of RBN company Refined Fuel Analytics shows. The tightness would be an incentive for Russia to keep diesel exports flowing now that the EU has banned imports, even at steep discounts. But in an Energy Intelligence base case, Russian diesel exports could drop by up to 300,000 b/d. For the world to be somewhat in balance for middle distillates, China would need to keep its refineries running higher for longer and export surplus diesel products â€ at a premium â€ into the world market. Jet fuel demand is growing from pent-up demand for international travel, with trans-Atlantic and Chinese skies opening up. Diesel consumption will be much impacted by weather, economic activity and the price of natural gas. The start of the year is showing a surprise increase in middle distillate stocks in Europe, where last minute imports from Russia ahead of a Feb. 5 product ban coincided with rising alternative imports and lower demand from falling natural gas prices. A mild winter also helped. Europe is bidding up diesel prices around the globe to fill its perpetual shortage. In January, refinery runs dropped by 840,000 b/d from December to 81.96 million barrels per day. While drops are seasonal, the fall was exacerbated by steep maintenance and bad weather in the US, where runs came off 620,000 b/d on the month after falling 830,000 b/d in December from November. Soft demand still saw US inventories for key fuels like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel grow in January after dropping in December. Rising stocks combined with continued high US refined product exports put downward pressure on product prices. Refinery margins for incremental runs were under pressure in December but rising again in the first half of January, Energy Intelligence shows â€ the result of product prices falling relative to crude prices. But rising margins means refiners will be buying more spot crude and run harder. January margins increased in Europe to $17.50 per barrel running Brent from $11 in December, to $18/bbl in the US from $10, and to $3.50/bbl from $1.75 in Asia. Europe has an additional incentive to increase runs now that natural gas prices have dropped to around $17 per million Btu. They are still around six times more than in the US, but off last year's highs. Additionally, European refiners can process heavier, sourer crude that can yield more diesel and jet now that it is cheaper to desulfurize.

"2023_2";"Turbulence and Decarbonization Reshape US Jet Fuel Market.txt";"  The wild ride for US jet fuel markets is expected to continue this year as turbulent weather patterns , resurgent aviation demand and the Ukraine war put pressure on middle distillates. Longer term, the gradual influx of sustainable aviation fuels could alleviate any tightness. Jet fuel cracks at more than $41 per barrel are soaring above all other products against incremental medium, sour crude in a complex Padd 3 facility, according to the Energy Intelligence downstream model. As 2023 progresses, jet cracks are likely to remain buoyant due to broader issues impacting the entire refined products slate and factors related to jet fuel market dynamics.  Jet cracks peaked in late January at almost $83/bbl when they outstripped diesel by $20, Energy Intelligence data show. In the wake of Winter Storm Elliot, severe cold shuttered significant downstream capacity in areas like the Gulf Coast that are ill-prepared for frigid temperatures. US downstream utilization sank to 79.6% in late December and has yet to climb back to pre-storm levels. Supply tightness has compounded the impact of already-low inventories in key travel hubs such as New York and especially in Florida â€ one of the fastest-growing jet markets in the US. Turbulent Forecast Utilization rates have recovered to 86.5% and the situation for jet fuel is starting to normalize. But tightness and volatile trading may persist even as temperatures climb into spring. Thatâ€™s because the US refinery complex is set to enter an unusually heavy maintenance season. Turnaround projects that were deferred as downstream players chased robust margins last year need to be completed to relieve the stress put on refining equipment and catalysts. Refiners have been operating their plants at full tilt with the utilization rate averaging 91% in 2022. Even though Exxon Mobilâ€™s Beaumont expansion is in start-up mode, its 250,000 barrels per day of incremental capacity wonâ€™t offset the more than 1 million b/d going off line for maintenance. Product supply in general will face a crunch as turnarounds intensify, at a time when diesel cracks are expected to strengthen again and pull some capacity away from jet fuel. The global market has so far ignored the EU embargo on Russian products . Some traders and refiners say that Europe has prepared for the initial impact of the ban on Russian diesel imports. The region nevertheless needs to replace the roughly 1 million b/d of fuel that still flowed in from Russia in January. Jet fuel comprised very little of that volume, which mainly consisted of 541,000 b/d in diesel supplies. During recent earnings calls, US downstream players said they expect to see Europe attract more diesel from the US, pricing at a premium to New York Harbor volumes. In the wake of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, US exports of diesel to Europe jumped from an average 35,000 b/d in January and February to over 95,000 b/d for the rest of the year. Trans-Atlantic shipments could now climb even higher. Refiners are churning out more diesel as its refining margins gain ground versus jet, with the road and industrial fuel now just $1/bbl below jet fuel at the refinery gate. Swing Supplier The US is becoming the swing producer and exporter of refined products as trade flows continue to shift one year after the start of the war in Ukraine. Refiners expect Russia to face problems accessing other markets for its fuels due to tight tanker availability and longer voyages to switch from nearby markets in Europe to more distant Latin American destinations. Meanwhile, jet fuel consumption in both the Americas and Europe is perking up at the same time that China emerges from zero-Covid-19 restrictions that had limited its air travel and jet usage. US jet exports were strong in 2022 but have recently trended even higher, with the four-week moving average hovering around 200,000 b/d since the start of this year. Latin America still accounts for the bulk of shipments. But in the second half of 2022 Europe began to increase its intake of US jet fuel â€ to over 8,000 b/d from 1,500 b/d in the first half. SAF Makes Inroads Another structural challenge is taking shape for conventional jet fuel in the longer term. The US government's ""aspirational"" goal to decarbonize aviation hinges on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) meeting all of US demand by 2050. Players are showing more interest in SAF now that new incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) put SAF on a more level playing field with renewable diesel. Refiners that announced conversions and projects in 2020 to produce renewable diesel are now turning their attention to jet. Valero is the newest entrant alongside Darling Ingredients. The two partners are investing in upgrading capacity that would enable 50% of the renewable diesel capacity at the Diamond Green Diesel facility to be utilized for SAF â€ some 235 million gallons per year. In California Phillips 66 and Southwest Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding last year for the supply of SAF from the Rodeo refinery â€ which is currently undergoing conversion into a renewable fuels plant. On the East Coast, Cresta Fund Management acquired a controlling stake in the Come-by-Chance refinery in Newfoundland, Canada, in 2021 and is converting that plant to produce renewable diesel and SAF. Independent refiner Marathon Petroleum is also exploring opportunities in the fast-emerging SAF sector.  Page 2 of 2 Turbulence and Decarbonization Reshape US Jet Fuel Market        "
"2023_3";"Airline Costs Reel From Tight U.S. Jet Fuel Market.txt";"   A surge in the number of passengers looking to travel via air is creating a tight jet fuel market that is pushing up costs for airlines and those looking to purchase flights, according to Reuters. Behind the U.S. jet fuel squeeze is a hoard of willing airline passengers who are looking to travel post-pandemic, after movements were restricted. According to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), there were 36.532 million barrels of kerosene-type jet fuel in the United States as of February 10-the lowest for this time of year since 1985, but up 714,000 barrels from the week prior. A distillate jet fuel competes with refinery time with other stretched class members such as diesel. The tight market has sent jet fuel prices to $3.37 per gallon, or $142 per barrel last year. For perspective, Reuters lists the 2019 average price for a gallon of jet fuel at just $2. This means that in 2022, airlines spend $56 billion on jet fuel alone-up from $36 billion in 2019. Now that China is backing away from its strict zero-covid policy, global airline traffic is set to see at least some level of increase, sucking up even more jet fuel and tightening the global jet fuel market even more. The United States has an ambitious plan to meet 100% of its jet fuel demand with sustainable fuel by the year 2050. But to achieve this goal, renewable jet fuel costs must come down substantially. Renewable jet fuel currently accounts for just 0.1% of all aviation fuel. High fossil fuel-derived jet fuel prices and the current tight market could spur innovation in the renewable jet fuel space. Airlines such as American Airlines are already investing in biofuels to come up with their own.  Page 2 of 2 Airline Costs Reel From Tight U.S. Jet Fuel Market        "
"2023_3";"CGTN _ Analysis_ China's economic resilience boosts global recovery prospects.txt";" Over the past three years, China has weathered several COVID-19 waves with massive vaccination drive. This has enabled the country to maintain the world's lowest rates of severe illness and mortality. In response to the constantly evolving situation, China has optimized its COVID-19 response strategy by coordinating epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development. In early 2023, China's economy is showing positive signs, with several developments suggesting its capacity to drive global growth. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that China's value-added industrial output, a crucial indicator on the supply side, increased by 2.4 percent year on year in the first two months of 2023. On the demand side, key metrics for consumption, investment and foreign trade rose during the same period. Retail sales of consumer goods and fixed-asset investment increased by 3.5 and 5.5 percent, respectively. Steady economic growth As consumer confidence is gradually restored and pro-consumption policies take effect, the NBS expects the revival of consumption to continue. To stimulate domestic consumption, the government has rolled out supportive policies nationwide, including issuing purchase vouchers to the public and launching consumption promotion festivals. China continues to put emphasis on high-quality development, including prompting the real economy, advancing high-end manufacturing and accelerating the construction of a modern industrial system, according to the State Council. The country is targeting steady economic growth and has set the gross domestic product (GDP) target at approximately 5 percent. Despite the rebound in the first two months of this year, China still needs to encourage consumer spending and strengthen the foundation for sustainable economic recovery, said NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui during a press conference last Wednesday. Starting from March 27, the People's Bank of China will reduce the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for financial institutions (excluding those already implementing a 5-percent ratio) by 0.25 percentage points. After the reduction, the weighted average RRR for lenders will drop to around 7.6 percent. The move is designed to maintain a reasonably ample amount of liquidity to serve the real economy and provide financing support to stimulate domestic demand. Stable growth amid difficulties China's economy has maintained stable growth amid the resurgence of COVID-19 in the past year. According to the NBS, the country's GDP hit an all-time high of 121 trillion yuan (about $17.95 trillion) in 2022, after surpassing the thresholds of 100 trillion yuan in 2020 and 110 trillion yuan in 2021. Meanwhile, value-added industrial output rose by 3.6 percent year on year. Notably, the high-tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing sectors showed significant growth momentum with the output values increasing by 7.4 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively. Despite multiple challenges over the past three years, China has maintained stability in its economy. It was one of the first countries in the world to resume work and reopen businesses in 2020 and was the only major economy to attain positive growth that year. ""China has been working on minimizing the impact of the pandemic on its supply chains and business operations,"" said Professor Liu Bin at the China Institute for WTO Studies under the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. To stabilize economic growth, China has implemented several policies, including mobilizing funds for infrastructure investment, reducing utility costs for market entities, and providing assistance to companies severely impacted by the pandemic to help ease their financial burdens. According to Liu, the rebound in China's economic growth is expected to be faster than in the international market, which is important for boosting confidence in the global economic recovery. Due to China's large role in global trade, its economic recovery could inject vitality into the global economy, said Liu. Data from the General Administration of Customs shows that China's total trade in goods reached 42.07 trillion yuan (about $6.21 trillion) in 2022, ranking first globally for a sixth consecutive year. In addition, official data shows that China has led the world in exports for 14 consecutive years, taking up 14.7 percent of the global export market. ""Apart from the important role that China plays in global trade, its exports also contribute greatly to its GDP growth,"" said Bai Rangrang, associate professor of the Department of Applied Economics at the School of Management under Fudan University. ""To some extent, it made up the gap in the drop of household consumption and business investment last year,"" he said, noting that an important factor behind this is that China has opened up wider to the world.

"2023_3";"Diesel Down Despite Supply Issues.txt";"   Crude and diesel prices headed in opposite directions in the shoulder season between winter heating and summer driving demand. Diesel prices fell even in Europe, which uses diesel as its main road fuel and faces the challenge of replacing Russian ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) imports. Europeâ€™s distillate traders seem impervious to the task ahead. Russian diesel exports are at a postwar high and sales outside of the EU are freeing up plenty of non-Russian alternatives to come to Europe.  Europe is importing more ULSD from regular suppliers in the Mideast Gulf and India as well as the US. The region is also drawing new volumes from farther east â€ China, Singapore and South Korea â€ as well as from Turkey, which is busy swapping Russian imports for its own fuels production. International crude benchmark Brent gained $3.36 per barrel or 4% over the week to close at $79.27/bbl Thursday, while US price-pin West Texas Intermediate put on $4.41/bbl to finish at a two-week high of $74.37/bbl. A softer US dollar propelled the gains. Banking turmoil and mounting evidence inflation may have peaked could mean an end to interest rate rises. ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures shed 3% of their value to close at a two-week low of $756.25 per metric ton ($101.37/bbl) Thursday. LSGO market backwardation has flattened out as prompt supply fears have eased: front-month futures were only $10.75/ton over the second-month on Mar. 30, down from $33/ton on Mar. 20. French pension protests are forcing jet fuel tankers to divert from Le Havre to Antwerp-Rotterdam-Amsterdam (ARA). Stock monitor Insights Global flagged a surprise 17% jump in ARA jet tanks this week after vessels carrying jet from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were forced to reroute to the trading hub. Jet stocks hit a nine-week high of 815,000 tons on Mar. 30. Parallel ARA gasoil inventories fell for a fifth week in a row as Europe continues to adjust to life without Russian diesel imports. Replacement ships arrived in ARA from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman alongside more European-made fuel that reached the trading hub. Two jet fuel cargoes changed hands in Plattsâ€™ end-of-day pricing window. Swiss trader Glencore sold 30,000 tons to heavyweight BP arriving in Amsterdam Apr. 16-20 at a $5/ton premium to the Platts' c.i.f. cargo mean in Mondayâ€™s window. Rival Shell went on to buy 30,000 tons from Glencore into Rotterdam Apr. 20-24 at a $49/ton premium to May ICE LSGO late Thursday. Cargo premiums were pegged at a $38/ton premium over the April screen, up $10/ton on the week. Europe is gearing up for a busy summer of flying, with the Easter holidays already narrowing the deficit from 2019 levels to just 10% this week. The recovery comes despite strike action and other disruptions in France and Germany. US jet fuel markets drifted lower as they succumbed to weaker fundamentals and a 3Â? per gallon drop in Nymex diesel futures, which settled at $2.64 on Thursday. Sales fell by 154,000 barrels per day to 1.44 million b/d in the week ended Mar. 24. Refiners ramped up production to 1.66 million b/d as maintenance turnarounds ended, driving utilization rates back above 90% of capacity. Imports receded to 125,000 b/d, but averaged above 180,000 b/d over the past months and 60% above year-earlier rates in February. The surplus lifted stocks by 1.4 million barrels to 38.2 million bbl â€ some 6% above the year-ago mark. US jet demand on the East Coast will be curbed this summer due to ongoing staff shortages. The Federal Aviation Administration told airlines to cut their peak summer schedules by 10% out of airports in the New York area and Washington, DC, due to a chronic shortage of air traffic controllers. Asian jet markets plunged with the Singapore spot price differential at one point tumbling to its lowest level in nearly six months. The Singapore differential sank to a 41Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Mar. 29, its lowest level since mid-October last year. The premium subsequently strengthened to 44Â?/bbl on Mar. 30, for a 19Â?/bbl drop from last week. Prompt jet demand has not derived much strength from regional air traffic trends. Scheduled airline capacity for the week of Mar. 27 shrank by 1.4% in Southeast Asia and fell by 1.8% in South Asia. Capacity also dipped by 1.3% in the Middle East, according to data analysis firm OAG. The largest regional market in Northeast Asia showed a 2.7% rise that offset some of the weakness.

After more than two years of the pandemic, the global economy began to recover, entering 2023, the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging markets and developing economies. to know how covid-19 pandemic and russia-ukraine war will impact this market- get a sample copy of the report Reasons to Purchase this Report - • Analyzing the outlook of the market with the recent trends and SWOT analysis.

"2023_3";"Market Consumers And Global Economic Transformation.txt";"  The emerged middle class are trailblazers in their own nations and represent, on a massive scale, agents of global economic transformation. Their effect on the global economy is already starkly apparent in the seismic shift in global economic gravity over the past few decades. Due to a myriad of factors, greater trade and investment flows, urbanization, expanding labor forces, rising wages, infrastructure spending, rising life expectancies, political stability, prudent macroeconomic management and, of course, the emerging middle classes of many developing nations, the world has been turned upside down. As recently as 1980, the world economy beat to the tune of the United States in particular and the developed economies in general. The West towered over the Rest. But, currently the tables have turned. According to the International Monetary Fund, where the developing nations accounted for roughly one-third of world GDP in 1980, this cohort now accounts for over 55% of the global total, with China, the world's second largest economy, leading the way. By pumping millions of new workers into the global labor force over the past three decades, China and other developing nations have dealt both a supply-side shock (more workers) and demand-side shock (more consumers) to the world economy. Much of the economic narrative over the past few years has been focused on the former, notably in many developed nations, the United States included, where the common refrain is that the rising supply of workers in the developing nations has undermined the jobs and incomes of workers in the West. To a degree, this is true, although many empirical studies suggest that more United States jobs have been lost to automation and technological advances than to low-cost labor in Mexico or China. The more salient point is that the millions of workers in the emerging markets are also consumers, with more disposable income than their parents or grandparents ever had. While the spending power of the West has been diminished by the United States-led financial crisis and ensuing austerity in Euro zone area of the European Union, the purchasing power among developing consumers is on a secular upswing. Where in the past factory workers in Asia would trudge off to work on Saturday morning, today they are more likely to head for the local shopping malls for a day of socialising and shopping. Any first-time visitor to the emerging cities of Shanghai, Dubai, Mumbai, Ho Chi Minh City, Istanbul and Sao Paulo is struck by the vigor and vitality of the local consumer, out in force and shopping in an air-conditioned mall that might be mistaken for a mall in suburban America. The size and scale of these urban buyers and their pent-up demand for electronic goods, appliances, automobiles, skin-care products, clothing and other goods are increasingly setting global trends. Emerging market consumers are leading in global fashion and driving global sales in a number of industries. Indeed, in a seminal shift, global consumption is tilting toward the developing nations and away from the United States and the West. According to both the recent UNDP and IMF documents, the gap in global personal consumption is narrowing in favor of the developing nations. Where the spread was roughly 80:20 in favor of the developed nations in 1980, the spread has now narrowed to roughly 60:40. And the will have little doubt that in the not-too-distant future, the lines will cross, with the newly emerging middle class poised to take the global baton of consumption from consumers in the West. And as the emerging market middle classes consume more, world trade flows are being altered. According to the IMF, a shift in world imports is well under way, with the developing nations' share of world imports reaching a record 56% last year, totalling a record $10.5 trillion. Again, in just a matter of years, the lines are set to cross and imports from the developing nations, led by rising purchases of goods and services from the middle class are set to easily supersede those of the developed nations. The aftershocks from the rise of the middle class in the developing nations are evident in various guises. Their pent-up demand for electronic goods, appliances, automobiles, skincare products, clothing and other goods has reached the point where emerging market consumers are now dictating the global revenues and profitability of these industries and others. In addition, as the new global consuming class adopts and acquires Western lifestyles, moves from the village to the city, works in air-conditioned offices, drives to work, consumes more protein, there will be greater demand and higher prices for energy, water, agricultural goods and other natural resources. Put in another way, the monopoly the West has long enjoyed in devouring the world's natural resources is over. For much of the post-Cold War era, the equation was rather simple. The developing nations produced commodities and the West consumed them. Those days however, are past. Millions of the new middle class consumers are pressuring the global commodity infrastructure. There is a dramatic shift in underlying demand for global energy, with the developing nations clearly now the global drivers of energy demand and prices. According to the IMF, the same holds true for the global consumption of meat, fruits and vegetables, with the developing nations, driven by a more affluent emerging market consumer, already out-consuming the developed nations. Pick virtually any commodity and the story is basically the same. Copper, silver, iron ore, meat, corn, wheat, soybeans, the future price of these commodities and others will increasingly reflect the rising per capita incomes and attendant jump in consumption among consumers in the developing nations. In the end, the world has changed. In the years ahead, the global economy will increasingly beat to the tune of millions of other middle-class consumers.

"2023_3";"Market Turmoil Extends to Jet.txt";"   Buoyant oil prices had the wind knocked out of them Thursday after the US deferred its plan to refill the countryâ€™s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. A series of releases following Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine have taken emergency stocks down to historic lows. SPR buybacks had been expected to tighten the market this year. But in Mar.  23 evidence to Congress, US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said it would be difficult at current prices. â€?We will continue to look for that low price into the future,â€ she added. Washington has been using the SPR as a tool to mitigate price spikes. A collapse in open interest amid the ongoing banking crisis and rush to liquidate funds has stoked oil price volatility with global benchmark Brent moving in a $4.50 per barrel daily range in the last week. The contract closed at $75.91/bbl Thursday, still up $1.21/bbl on the week. US domestic price-pin WTI gained $1.61/bbl to end the week at $69.96/bbl. Prices had been climbing before the SPR bombshell on more dovish rhetoric from central banks. Moves by regulators to shore up the global financial system following several bank collapses and near-misses also shored up prices. Persistent macroeconomic worries and softening fundamentals remain major risks to the downside. Europeâ€™s jet market has finally lost its shallow contango as French disruptions and lower import volumes heighten supply fears. Jet traders appeared spooked by reports airlines were tankering in fuel into Paris Charles de Gaulle airport amid widespread protests over government plans to raise the state pension age from 62 to 64. Spot jet cargo premiums skyrocketed to $28.25 per ton premium over pumped up front-month ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures at Thursdayâ€™s close, up from $14.25/ton the day before and a recent low of just $4.25/ton on Monday. Cargoes were pegged at a $17.50/ton premium this time last week. Around 1.3 million tons of jet is expected to arrive in Europe this month, according to tanker trackers, down from 1.8 million tons in February. The week saw just one public jet cargo deal: Swiss trader Vitol buying 30,000 tons from rival Glencore into Rotterdam Apr. 11-15 at a $11/ton premium to April ICE LSGO futures in Tuesdayâ€™s window. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp rose for the second week in a row to hit 696,000 tons on Mar. 23, according to Insights Global, which flagged tankers arriving in ARA from France and India. Stocks are currently 23% lower than year-earlier levels. European air traffic was still 12.5% below 2019 levels in the week to Mar. 23, according to Eurocontrol. The network manager flagged a near-24% deficit in France on â€?Black Thursdayâ€ as protests intensified. US jet fuel markets held steady as basis diesel futures hovered near the $2.67 per gallon mark. Fundamentals have also settled onto a plateau, with sales and production both around 1.6 million b/d. Refiners have boosted utilization rates to 88.6% of capacity as the maintenance season winds down. Jet yields of 10.3% have climbed back up levels last seen in January. But that could change after distillate stocks plunged by 3.3 million barrels in the week ended Mar. 17 to levels that are 9% below the five-year average. Gasoline stocks fell by 6.4 million bbl and were 4% below five-year trends. Refiners now have a strong incentive to switch yields toward diesel in the run-up to the summer driving season: diesel cracks have surpassed jet, reaching $41.75/bbl while jet returns stayed at $39 in the week ending Mar. 17 according to Energy Intelligence downstream data. Asian jet markets weakened after a deal was concluded at a lower spot premium in the Singapore trading window. The benchmark spot price differential weakened by 10Â?/bbl from last week to a 63Â?/bbl premium on Mar. 23. A total of 100,000 bbl of April-loading jet traded from Mar. 17-23 in the Platts Singapore trading window. The volumes were all sold in one lot by BP on Mar. 21 at a 50Â?/bbl premium to Vitol. This brought down the benchmark spot price by 10Â?/bbl from the previous day to a 57Â?/bbl premium on Mar. 21. Rising air traffic in Northeast Asia boosted prompt jet demand in the region.

"2023_3";"Oil mixed over growing global economic growth uncertainties.txt";" Oil prices were mixed on Tuesday as negative global economic growth forecasts raised demand concerns, while a buyout deal of the defunct Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) allayed investor concerns about the United States banking system. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $77.65 per barrel at 09:57 a.m. local time (0657 GMT), a 0.14 percent decrease from the closing price of $77.76 a barrel in the previous trading session. At the same time, American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at $72.95 per barrel, a 0.19 percent rise after the previous session closed at $72.81 a barrel. Investors are still focused on the ongoing financial crisis in the US and the trajectory of the Chinese economy and oil demand outlook. The World Bank said Monday that it expects global economic growth to fall to its lowest level in three decades by the end of 2030, referring to the period from now until then as the ""lost decade."" ""The global economy's 'speed limit'-the maximum long-term rate at which it can grow without sparking inflation-is set to slump to a three-decade low by 2030,"" it said in a report, Falling Long-Term Growth Prospects: Trends, Expectations, and Policies. The bank said nearly all the economic forces that powered progress and prosperity over the last three decades were fading, forcing a decline in global potential gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 2022 and 2030. ""These declines would be much steeper in the event of a global financial crisis or a recession,"" the World Bank warned. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva echoed similar fears, pointing to increasing financial stability risks while market uncertainties remain high. Prices saw some bullish support over calming concerns about the US financial crisis after the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced Monday that the First Citizens Bank agreed to buy SVB's deposits and loans, approximately $72 billion of the failed bank's assets, at a discount of $16.5 billion.

"2023_3";"PERSISTENT INFLATION, BANKING TURMOIL CLOUD GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.txt";" Economic growth in the United States and Europe in 2023 and 2024 is projected to be below trend, according to analysis presented at the Spring 2023 Peterson Institute for International Economics' Global Economic Prospects. Demand and output have been more resilient than anticipated, and inflationalthough seeming to have peaked in many countriesremains high. As a result, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks will continue to maintain tight financial conditions. In addition, the potential for further turmoil in the banking system increases negative tail risk for economic activity. Global GDP will increase 2.9 percent in 2023 and 3.1 percent in 2024. US GDP in 2023 is projected to be about 1.3 percent above its 2022 level, and in 2024 is projected to rise 1.0 percent. Core US personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation will moderate from a pace of 4.8 percent over the four quarters of 2022 to 3.9 percent over the four quarters of 2023 and 3.2 percent over the four quarters of 2024. In the United States, incoming data have been stronger than expected, with consumers still having pent-up demand and (in the aggregate) the wherewithal to finance it. US labor demand has eased, but only slightly. Meanwhile, US inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's target. High inflation continues to impose costs on the economy and on individuals and families: Although many workers have seen higher-than-usual wage growth over the past year, growth in average hourly earnings in many industries has fallen short of price increases. The recent failures, forced sales, and strains at multiple banks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions as banks respond to the outflow of deposits, stricter supervision, and possible regulatory changes. The extent of this tightening is difficult to measure and predict, but it will probably induce only a modest additional drag on economic activityand so, the Fed will likely still need to make a couple of further 25 basis point hikes to bring inflation down toward its target. Based on the available information, below-trend economic growth, with some rise in the unemployment rate, is more likely than a recession in the United States. But risks tilt to the downside because of the possibility of further contagion among banks, the potential for additional inflationary shocks, and the intrinsic difficulties of achieving a soft landing. Tight financial conditions will constrain economic growth this year and next in many other advanced economies as well. Still, Europe appears to have dodged a recession this winter, and its prospects going forward are brighter than a few months ago. The United Kingdom is projected to lag other advanced economies and see very low or negative growth this year and next given its greater challenges with inflation. Growth prospects diverge for the major emerging economies. China is rebounding because of its reopening from COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns and a fading drag from its property sector. In India, progress on reforms will bolster activity. By contrast, high interest rates and structural problems will continue to weigh on economic activity in Brazil, and Russia continues to experience fallout from its Ukraine invasion.

"2023_3";"Prices Slip as Supply Fears Ease.txt";"  Oil markets are adjusting to new crude and product flows after Europe's ban on Russian imports although jet fuel's supply resilience has yet to be tested, with air traffic still not back to pre-Covid-19 levels. Headline crude oil prices fell back on concerns that oil demand growth will be swamped by even bigger increases in production this year. International benchmark Brent shed $3.16 per barrel over the week to close at $81.59/bbl Thursday, losing all the gains of the previous week and more. US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate dropped $2.44/bbl to finish at $75.72/bbl. Crudeâ€™s forward curves are certainly reflecting a looser market.  WTI is now in contango on the front, with the prompt-month trading at a discount to later-dated contracts signaling a well-supplied market. Brent is still backwardated but the premium for prompt delivery is becoming less steep. Russia is struggling to find easy homes for all its diesel. A growing number of tankers are congregating offshore Gibraltar while they await orders, often to go long distances. A hefty 29.4 million barrels (3.9 million metric tons) of Russian diesel loaded at Baltic and Black Sea ports in the month after the ban. Around 30% is going to Turkey, which is pumping out non-Russian diesel for Europe in its place, and 20% to end-user markets in North Africa. Another 20% was still unsold on Mar. 5 with the rest searching out long-haul markets in West Africa, the Middle East, Brazil and even South Korea. Europe is meanwhile still living off stocks of Russian fuel built up before the embargo and a decent flow of non-Russian imports. Gasoil tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) fell for a second week but were still almost 2.5 million tons on Mar. 9, according to Insights Global. The stock monitor tracked diesel cargoes arriving from China, Kuwait, Qatar and Singapore this week. Diesel prices are falling with benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures and ultra-low-sulfur diesel cargo premiums both down on the week. Market backwardation is flattening as supply fears ease. Front-month ICE LSGO futures were just $2.50 per ton above the second-month at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from $9.75/ton a week ago. Europeâ€™s jet fuel spot market sprang back to life with a record 11 cargo lots or 330,000 metric tons (bbl) changing hands in Plattsâ€™ end-of-day pricing window between Mar. 3-9. European heavyweight BP was on the buy-side of eight of them, taking 240,000 tons. French oil company TotalEnergies, Saudi Aramco and Swiss trader Glencore were all selling. The weekâ€™s cargo deals were mostly done on a floating price basis. Jet cargo premiums were pegged at a $38.75/ton premium to the front-month LSGO at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from $43.50/ton a week ago. Regional air traffic is still expected to get back to pre-Covid-19 levels this summer. Departures were stuck 14% below 2019 levels in the week to Mar. 9, according to Eurocontrol, with a general strike in France causing disruptions. Fuel deliveries that included barges were caught up in the dispute about raising the French retirement age, but refinery capacity has yet to be affected. Lengthy pay disputes saw up to 70% of French capacity shut in for most of last summer. Jet imports are flagging with arrivals into Northwest Europe falling from 1.6 million tons in February to just 1.1 million tons scheduled this month, according to the latest tanker tracking. Jet tanks in ARA fell to 635,000 tons on Mar. 9, according to Insights Global, after no jet import tankers discharged into Europe's main trading hub for the fourth week in a row. Brokers say ARA will only get two jet tankers at most this month amid signs vital infrastructure is being given over to diesel. Bellwether ARA jet tanks are now at their lowest level since April 2020. They are still above the record low of 395,000 tons seen in March 2020, just before Covid-19 restrictions shuttered the aviation industry. US jet fuel markets tracked the drop in low-sulfur diesel futures, which lost 16Â?/gallon on the week to close at $2.68 on Thursday. The weakness defies a relatively tight situation for fundamentals, with stocks dropping by 400,000 bbl to 37.2 million bbl in the week ended Mar. 3 â€ nearly 5% below year-ago levels when demand was much lower. Sales jumped by 140,000 b/d to 1.65 million b/d, while output climbed by just 42,000 b/d to 1.59 million b/d. Utilization rates are creeping back up following maintenance shutdowns. Refiners have a strong incentive to concentrate on jet fuel production, with jet cracks of more than $49/bbl outstripping diesel margins, which averaged below $42/bbl in early March. Asian jet markets lost ground as benchmark Singapore spot price differentials slid to their lowest level in 4Â? months. Prices succumbed to pressure from a drop in Asian arbitrage jet heading westward and falling air traffic in East of Suez aviation markets. Singapore spot price differentials slipped to a 68Â?/bbl premium on Mar. 3, the lowest level since Oct. 17. A subsequent recovery brought the differential back to 70Â?/bbl above Singapore quotes on Mar. 9 â€ a decline of 12Â?/bbl from last week. Several March-loading shipping fixtures are no longer heading from Asia to the West, according to Kpler data. A total of 2.2 million bbl of arbitrage jet is now scheduled to load in the Mar. 13-29 period from India, China and South Korea. The cargoes are all pointed at Europe with expected arrival dates ranging from Apr. 5 to May 13. Latest Kpler data indicate that 852,000 bbl of arbitrage jet have loaded from Mar. 6-8 from Kuwait and are headed to East Africa and Europe, with expected arrival dates in late March.

"2023_3";"World Bank expects slow global economic growth.txt";" The global economy is facing an era of worsening demographics, ongoing inflation pressure and financial instability, according to a gloomy new report  from The World Bank.  Why it matters: If the economy is like a car, its potential growth rate is how quickly it can go without risking a ticket — or excess inflation. The World Bank says this ""speed limit"" has fallen dramatically, warning that forces juicing global economic growth are now in retreat. • A nation's potential growth rate sets boundaries that can affect a slew of policies, including government spending and benchmark interest rates.  What they're saying:""The result could be a lost decade in the making—not just for some countries or regions as has occurred in the past—but for the whole world,"" bank officials wrote in the report.  By the numbers: The World Bank estimates that the globe's potential growth rate will average 2.2% throughout the rest of this decade. That would make it the lowest rate in 30 years. • For context, that rate was 3.5% in the early 2000s, and 2.6% between 2011 and 2021.   The reasons for that slowdown in potential output stem from a slew of factors, many of which are problems that were made worse by the effects of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. • That includes sluggish productivity and labor force growth and tempered international trade. The organization points to a lasting shock to human capital from COVID-19, learning losses and school closures that will weigh on potential growth.  The big picture: The drop-off will have wide-ranging consequences, limiting every nation's ability to invest in measures that would reduce poverty, combat climate change or boost job creation to find new venues to up productivity. • ""All of these things will be curtailed because of weaker potential growth going forward,"" Ayhan Kose, the group's chief economist, told reporters this morning.   The bottom line: The World Bank says a slew of policies — including ones that slash trade-related costs, embrace globalization and increase labor force participation rates — could raise the globe's potential growth rate. • Still, plenty of risks loom, including the potential for a  worsening bank crisis .  • ""The slowdown we're describing could be much sharper if another global financial crisis erupts, especially if that crisis is accompanied by a global recession,"" Kose says.

"2023_4";"IMF _ Global economic recovery faces challenges.txt";"According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is continuing to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, but the road to recovery is becoming more challenging. Despite this, the agency has stated that the gradual recovery remains on track, and China's reopening of its economy is rebounding strongly. Moreover, supply chain disruptions in the world economy are gradually being resolved, which is a positive development. The IMF has pointed out that dislocations to energy and food markets caused by the war are receding, which is a positive sign for the global economy. In addition, the agency has highlighted that the massive and synchronized tightening of monetary policy by most central banks is expected to start bearing fruit, with inflation moving back towards targets. The IMF has projected that inflation will slow to 5.1 percent in 2023, which is a significant downward revision of 0.6 percentage points from its January projection. This forecast indicates that the global economy is moving towards a more stable and sustainable recovery. However, the agency has also noted that the road to recovery is becoming increasingly challenging, and policymakers must remain vigilant in monitoring and managing risks to ensure the continued resilience of the global economy. In conclusion, while the global economy is continuing to recover from the pandemic and other challenges, it is important to note that the road to recovery is not without its obstacles. The IMF's latest report highlights the need for policymakers to remain vigilant in their efforts to safeguard the stability of the global economy, as the recovery process continues.

"2023_4";"IMF Lowers Global Economic Growth Forecast To 2.8%.txt";"  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its outlook for global economic growth to 2.8% from 2.9% previously.  The Washington, D.C.-based financial agency of the United Nations said its view of the global economy has dimmed slightly due to persistent inflation, continued interest rate hikes, and a recent crisis among U.S. and European banks.  The IMF added that the potential for a ""hard landing,"" in which rising interest rates lead to a global recession has ""risen sharply"" in recent months among the world's wealthiest countries.   The international financial institution also forecast 7% worldwide inflation this year, up from its previous forecast of 6.6%.  Stubbornly high inflation is expected to force the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to continue lifting interest rates and keep them at or near peak levels longer to help lower consumer prices.   The IMF now forecasts a 25% likelihood that global economic growth will fall below 2% this year. That has happened only five times since 1970, most recently when COVID-19 slammed the breaks on the global economy in 2020.  The agency said it now expects the U.S., the world's largest economy, to grow 1.6% this year, up from 1.4% it had predicted in January of this year.   In Europe, the IMF forecasts lacklustre growth of 0.8%, up slightly from its previous forecast. China's economy is expected to grow 5.2% this year, unchanged from an earlier forecast.

"2023_4";"Surprise Opec -Plus Cut Revives Prices.txt";"  Sagging oil prices prompted Opec-plus to act over the weekend with eight states including Russia announcing output cuts of 1.657 million barrels per day in an attempt to shore up the market. The cuts will run from May until the end of the year and will actually take a potential 1.2 million b/d off the market given Russiaâ€™s existing shut-ins. It was enough to push benchmark Brent above $85 per barrel. Prices had fallen into the low-$70s/bbl in March amid concerns about a global banking crisis, recession and uncertain oil demand with Chinaâ€™s recovery still falling short of expectations.  Brent had already rebounded to about $80/bbl prior to the Opec-plus announcement. The international price-pin finished the shorter pre-Easter trading week up $5.72/bbl at $84.99/bbl by Wednesdayâ€™s close. US benchmark WTI put on $6.24/bbl to end the week at $80.61/bbl. Bumper flows of non-Russian fuel are keeping a tighter lid on Europeâ€™s diesel prices. India has all but scrapped export taxes, allowing domestic refiners to take full advantage of cheap Russian crude. Saudi Aramco's new Jazan refinery means the Middle East is pumping out record volumes of ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD). ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures were slow to react to the Opec-plus production cuts with market backwardation also flattening as traders become more relaxed about Europe's longer diesel supply chains. Front month LSGO futures are now just $4 per metric ton over the second month, down from a hefty $33/ton markup on Mar. 20. European jet cargo premiums are storming ahead as fuel supply chains are suddenly threatened in the crucial run-up to peak summer demand. Brokers warned the regionâ€™s lifeblood arbitrage from Asia is now closed with cargoes already on the water at risk of diverting to the US. Cargoes were pegged at a $46.75/ton premium to front-month ICE LSGO futures at Wednesdayâ€™s close, up from $39.50/ton a week ago. Tanker tracking already shows only 1.1 million tons arriving this month assuming there are no diversions. The actual figure is likely to be lower. Steep tanker rates are not helping arbitrage prospects with long-range tankers increasingly being used to carry ULSD. Europe desperately needs more jet fuel: air traffic is set to go 15% above pre-Covid-19 levels this summer, according to new guidance issued Apr. 4 by Eurocontrol. The network manager has issued an â€? All Together Now 2023 â€ practical guide to operations this summer. Ukrainian and Russian airspace are off limits and three times as many military flights are taking place. Regional departures were only 8.7% below 2019 levels in the week to Apr. 5. No jet cargoes traded in the pricing window this week despite offers from Swiss trader Glencore and Chinaâ€™s Unipec into Rotterdam. Ships are still avoiding French ports as the risk of strike disruptions continue. Glencore named the Hafnia Yangtze coming from Kuwait and Unipec the Proteus Rebecca en route from South Korea. Energy Intelligence data show a bumper 960,000 tons of jet changing hands in the cargo window in the first quarter, making it the busiest trading start to the year since 2010. US middle distillates have gotten so used to external pressures that they were less affected than crude by the sudden cut in Opec-plus supplies. Nymex low-sulfur diesel futures recovered the ground they lost last week to close at $2.68 per gallon on Wednesday. For time time being the jet fuel market is well-balanced. A 250,000 b/d jump in sales to nearly 1.7 million b/d was matched by producer output totaling 1.68 million b/d in the week ended Mar. 31, according to government data. The severe shortage of air traffic controllers at the three New York area airports will keep a lid on peak summertime demand, ensuring that logistical pressures that crop up in summer to ship additional supplies into JFK will ease this year. Overall US jet stocks totaled 38 million barrels at end-March, some 7.5% above year-ago levels. An influx of imported cargoes drove East Coast tanks up by 800,000 bbl to 9.6 million bbl â€ one-third higher than last year. Steady export flows drew Gulf Coast inventories down by 600,000 bbl to 18.5 million. Jet fuel margins continued to slide to new year-lows in Asia as Chinaâ€™s long-awaited recovery failed to meet market expectations. ICE reports a surge in open interest in its Singapore jet swaps products as the market takes bets on jet fuel's revival. A long state holiday at the start of May is seen as the next possible trigger for jet fuel demand in Asia. Chinaâ€™s jet export prospects have also dimmed amid reports refiners have used up most of their export quotas. No jet cargoes changed hands in the Singapore trading window with the last public deal on Mar. 21. Market valuations dipped from a 44Â?/bbl premium over the mean of Platts Singapore quotas a week ago to just 25Â?/bbl at Thursdayâ€™s close. European heavyweight Shell meanwhile revealed this week it was cancelling plans for a 550,000 tons per year sustainable aviation fuel plant in Singapore.

"2023_4";"The fragile global economy.txt";" Over the past three years the global economy has been subjected to an unprecedented series of shocks. After the pandemic struck, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine brought added disruption. Both contributed to a cost of living crisis, with central banks raising interest rates rapidly to contain runaway inflation. Arguably, the international economic system has displayed remarkable resilience. The most downbeat forecasts for a widescale financial crisis and a chain of debt defaults by low income countries has been avoided so far. But the global economy is badly scarred. The IMF projects the weakest global medium-term growth prospects for  over 30 years. Policymakers gathering at the World Bank/IMF spring meetings this week have their work cut out to stabilise the global economy and shift it on to a higher growth path. The IMF forecasts global growth to be  2.8 per cent this year, down slightly on expectations in January. It also places a 25 per cent chance that growth could fall below 2 per cent. Indeed, price pressures are proving more persistent than anticipated and economic conditions have become more fragile. A top official at the IMF  warned of “acute” risks to the global financial system, and many advanced economies are expected to be sluggish this year, as high interest rates squeeze credit. Getting the global economy back on track will mean grappling with several pressing risks. Although some calm has returned to the banking system following the collapse of three US banks and Credit Suisse’s emergency takeover by UBS in March, financial markets remain on shaky ground. Central banks can see the end of this rate hiking cycle, but the rapid reversal of a decade of cheap money is exposing vulnerabilities. There are concerns over the impact of high interest rates on commercial real estate and the non-bank sector. Central bankers face a balancing act: they must limit further instability and ensure high inflation does not become entrenched. At the same time higher borrowing costs are hitting developing countries that have amassed enormous debts dealing with the pandemic and high food and energy prices, exacerbated by a strong dollar.  Around 60 per cent of low-income countries are at high risk of or already in debt distress. The poorest countries also face the largest bills for servicing foreign debts  in 25 years.  High debt burdens complicate the task for developing countries which need over  $2tn a year by 2030 to cut emissions and deal with damage from climate change. Boosting efforts to tackle global warming is paramount to prevent people in poor countries falling deeper into poverty, and to drive growth and job creation. Geopolitical risks are also undermining global prospects. The IMF finds that the long-term cost of  trade fragmentation, as a result of tensions between the US and China, could be around 7 per cent of global GDP. Barriers to trade, investment and technology transfer would limit growth, particularly in poorer countries. Policymakers will need to mitigate these risks. Regulators will have to remain vigilant to the knock-on impacts of high interest rates; the recent banking crisis also ought to be a wake-up call to improve bank and non-bank regulation. There is hope that progress on a framework to restructure developing world debt in an orderly manner across creditors, including China, is possible at the meetings. Efforts to mobilise more financing for climate change from international financial institutions, both through more efficient use of their balance sheets and via private sector partnerships are vital too. The complex and connected challenges facing countries require an ambitious and co-operative global response. This week’s meetings are a crucial moment to set that in motion.

"2023_5";"G7 Finance Ministers, Central Bankers to Discuss Global Economic Risks.txt";"  Global economic risks, including stubbornly high inflation and the fallout from aggressive US and European interest rate increases, will be among the key topics of debate for the G7 finance ministers and central bankers. The meeting will discuss ways to strengthen the global financial system, steps to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, and diversifying supply chains away from countries like China through partnerships with low- and middle-income nations. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the global economy is in a ""better place than many had predicted six months ago,"" with inflation moderating in many G7 countries including the US. However, as rapid rate hikes by the Federal Reserve weigh on the US economy, recent data has shown signs of weakness in China, the world's second-largest economy. China's consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in more than two years in April, while factory gate deflation deepened, data showed on Thursday, dashing policymakers' hopes that a rebound in the country's demand would underpin global growth. The G7 nations include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US. Other invitees to the meetings in Niigata include the EU, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank, and the finance ministers of Brazil, Comoros, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Singapore. The meeting will discuss ways to prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine and diversify supply chains away from countries like China through partnerships with low- and middle-income nations. The G7 finance ministers and central bankers will discuss global economic risks, including inflation and interest rate increases. The meeting will focus on ways to strengthen the global financial system and prevent Russia from circumventing sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, the participants will discuss diversifying supply chains away from countries like China through partnerships with low- and middle-income nations. While the global economy is in a better place than many had predicted six months ago, rapid rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are weighing on the US economy, and recent data has shown signs of weakness in China. The G7 nations and other invitees will work together to address these challenges and promote global economic growth.

"2023_5";"Global economy overcomes high inflation -- OPEC.txt";"The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said in its monthly report that the global economy continues to overcome the challenges represented by high inflation, high interest rates in the US and the Eurozone, and high debt levels in many regions of the world. OPEC's report, which was distributed in Vienna Thursday, stated that the global economy grew by 3.3 percent for the year 2022 and is expected to reach 2.6 percent in 2023, both of which were unchanged from the previous month's assessment. The forecast for economic growth in the US for the year 2023 remains unchanged at 1.2 percent, after a growth of 2.1 percent for the year 2022, it said. The Eurozone's economic growth forecast for 2023 remains at 0.8 percent, after growth of 3.5 percent for 2022, it noted Japan's economic growth forecast for 2022 remains at 1.0 percent for both 2022 and 2023, it mentioned. China's economic growth forecast remains at 5.2 percent for 2023, compared with 3 percent for 2022, the report stated. India's 2022 economic growth estimate is unchanged at 6.7 percent, and the forecast for 2023 remains at 5.6 percent. Russia's growth is also unchanged across both years, with an estimated contraction of 2.1 percent for 2022 and a smaller forecast contraction of 0.5 percent for 2023. The report dealt with the demand for OPEC crudes this year, describing it as stable and an increase of 800,000 barrels over the previous year. The demand for OPEC crudes in 2023 remained unchanged from the previous assessment, standing at 29.3 million barrels per day (bpd), it pointed out. The organization indicated in its report for the month of April that this demand remains about 800,000 bpd higher than it was in 2022. On the average price of the OPEC Reference Basket, it increased by USD 5.68, or 7.2 percent, monthly, to reach USD 84.13 per barrel (pb). The benchmark Brent crude rose by USD 4.16, or 5.3 percent, on a monthly basis, to reach USD 83.37 pb, and the price of US West Texas crude increased by USD 6.07, or 8.3 percent per month, to reach USD 79.44 pb. The OPEC report reviewed the world oil demand and said that the estimates for 2022 remained unchanged from last month's assessment, with a growth of 2.5 million bpd on an annual basis. Estimates on global oil supplies from outside OPEC indicate that they grew by 1.9 million bpd in 2022, broadly unchanged from the previous month's assessment. The main drivers of growth in crude supplies for 2022 were the US, Russia, Canada, Guyana, China and Brazil, while the largest declines was observed in Norway and Thailand. For the year 2023, the forecast for non-OPEC liquids production growth remained unchanged from last month's assessment at 1.4 million bpd on an annual basis, it said. It is expected that the US, Brazil, Norway, Canada, Kazakhstan and Guyana are the main drivers of growth in the supply of crude oil, while it is expected to decline mainly in Russia. Uncertainties remain, primarily related to the potential of US shale oil output and unplanned field maintenance in 2023, the report stressed. Preliminary data showed an increase in US imports of crude oil to 6.3 million bpd in April, amid preparations for the summer driving season. OPEC's report continued to mention that US crude exports fell back from a record high to average a still strong 4.2 million bpd. In March, China's crude imports surged to a new record of 12.4 million bpd, following a wave of buying by Chinese refiners, including from long-haul sources. The preliminary estimates for April show Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Europe crude imports were seasonally lower, while product imports picked up from lower levels in February and March, OPEC said in its report.

"2023_5";"Jet Fuel_ Airlines Forecast Strong Summer Demand Expanding Flight Capacity.txt";"  Highlight: We forecast jet fuel prices to rise from current spot levels of USD100/bbl to a global annual average of USD110/bbl for 2023, but this still marks a substantial revision of 22% lower than our previous forecast for USD140/bbl.  Despite the recent collapse in jet fuel margins, we expect a recovery in spreads in the coming months. Strong consumption coupled with reduced refinery output support prices as refiners move to protect middle distillate margins with inventories continuing to widen in response to slowing demand to global economic headwinds.  Total number of flights globally has now surpassed pre-pandemic levels although the makeup of flights still remains skewed to domestic routes with long-haul flights underperforming, leaving overall jet fuel demand with additional room to recover fully.  Despite the rise in interest rates triggered by high inflation and gloomy economic outlook most airlines are anticipating strong demand in the near-term especially during the peak summer travel season. The outlook for strong demand for air travel is due to post-pandemic factors including pent-up demand and excess savings despite expectations for elevated fares in most markets.  • We forecast jet fuel prices to rise from current spot levels of USD100/bbl to a global annual average of USD110/bbl for 2023, but this still marks a substantial revision of 22% lower than our previous forecast for USD140/bbl. • Despite the recent collapse in jet fuel margins, we expect a recovery in spreads in the coming months.

The outlook for strong demand for air travel is due to post-pandemic factors including pent-up demand and excess savings despite expectations for elevated fares in most markets. Short-Term Outlook (3-6 Months)We hold a bullish view from current spot price levels despite the sharp contraction in jet fuel refining margins since the start of the year. We expect a recovery in jet fuel prices in the coming months with the onset of the peak summer travel season, albeit well below levels seen in 2022. Expectations are high for strong consumption buoyed by airline forecasts for increased capacity gains to pre-Covid levels and strong bookings for summer holidays. Our forecast expects both a slight rise in Brent prices from current levels supported by a strong economic recovery in China and shallower than expected recession in Europe and the US. Refining margins are set to recovery as seasonal demands picks-up and the recent weakness seen in middle distillates is countered by refiner's reduction in output. In our view, the sharp contraction in global refining margins will see refiners pull back on refining runs to support elevated margins but not enough to see margins approach the all-time highs seen in 2022.   We forecast jet fuel prices to rise from current spot levels to a global annual average of USD110/bbl for 2023, but this still marks a substantial revision of 22% lower than our previous forecast for USD140/bbl amid YTD price weakness. The pace of jet fuel price declines has outpaced those of oil with the US market YTD facing the steepest declines in pricefs followed by Europe. The more rapid decline in jet fuel prices has seen margins contract sharply although the declines in Brent price has softened the blow for refineries. However, we hold the view that prevailing slowing demand in fuels globally will see refiners pare back output in the coming months. This is due a desire to preserves elevated margins in the face of the addition of new refining capacity coming to market but also to prevent excessive storage builds which could erode margins in the longer-term.  Long-Term Outlook Our price forecast expects all markets to post stronger refining margins from lows currently seen during Q223, as both demand and supply look to reverse trajectory. Strong demand for air travel is expected in the coming years as pent-up demand from Covid-19 boost appetite for air travel despite high airfares and the wider high inflationary environment. Although, the global macroeconomic environment has proved more resilient, our country risk team forecast global economic growth to slow from 2022 as high interest rates weigh on growth. Total number for flights globally has now surpassed pre-pandemic levels although the makeup of flights still remains skewed to domestic routes with long-haul flights underperforming, leaving overall jet fuel demand with additional room to recover fully. China remains one of the last major markets to post a full recovery but domestic flights are gaining ground and new long-haul routes are being added to increase capacity. However, long-haul flights as measured by passenger volume remains 82% below pre-pandemic levels but has recently posted strong monthly gains amid the easing Covid restrictions. Domestic passenger volumes point to wider normalisation with numbers indicating a near recovery at just 6% below pre-Covid levels for March. But for global flight numbers as a whole volume has return to at or above pre-Covid levels.   Despite the return of passengers and flight numbers total jet fuel demand as a share of pre-Covid 19 levels consumption remains below pre-pandemic levels. One factor behind this is prevalence of domestic flights over long-haul flights, which are still lacking in both passengers and flight capacity. However, long-planned capacity increases and easing labour shortages are setting stage for a return in long-haul flights for this year, although we do not expect demand to return to pre-Covid levels until well into 2024, as the last of the Asia markets fully re-integrates into international travel itinerary.Supply imbalances are expected to improve softening the overall margins when compared to 2022, but still remaining elevated as we expect refineries to reduce runs to compensate for slack demand from other middle distillates limiting markets' access to jet fuel to boost margins. We forecast New York jet fuel spot prices to average USD120/bbl for 2023, from spot levels at USD95/bbl currently. The revision lower of New York forecast marks a 25% reduction from our previous forecast. Much of the rise in prices will be due to a recovery in refining margins and mild gains in Brent. New York's strong price premium was exacerbated by low stock levels throughout Q2 2022 and for the last data to February 2023 we see levels at 9.7% from a year earlier easing price upside for the year to date. Despite the inventory gains strong demand and the potential for supply disruption pose meaningful upside to prices well above their regional peers. Singapore and Rotterdam jet fuel prices are forecast to average USD101/bbl and 108/bbl respectively as the recovery in refining margins is expected to be much more muted. In Singapore's case increased regional fuel exports from China will add to inventories while strong availability of fuel imports will also temper the expected recovery in margins. The Singapore and Rotterdam revisions are 17% and 12% lower than our previous forecast.The impact of sustainable aviation fuel adoption is expected to grow with agreement within the EU on adoption of increasingly higher shares of total demand. The latest agreement from April 2023 focuses on setting a goal for airports to supply sustainable aviation fuel at 6% of available fuel by 2030 rising to nearly 70% of fuel availability by 2050. Expectations are for the bulk to be provided by utilising renewable sources from vegetable oil and animals fats and tallow. A smaller share, 1.2% of the 6% total by 2030 will be sourced via synthetic means using direct air capture and green hydrogen. The share of this synthetic version of jet fuel will rise to 35% of fuel supplied by 2050. In our view, the impact to global markets will be fairly minimal up the medium-term with the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel unlikely to made inroads immediately with targets for 2025 at just 2%. However, in the long-term the conversion of existing refinery capacity to sustainable feedstock will see an increasing share of jet fuel derived from non-crude sources, which will support elevated prices as we expect sustainable jet fuel to hold a premium in the market raising prices overall. Fundamentals We hold our view that markets will remain broadly in balance in the coming years with risks tilted to the downside. A show of constraint from refiners will see supply fall in line with the mild growth averaging 1.4% annually to 2032. We expect for demand growth for jet fuel of 7.3% in 2023 the third year of growth after 2022 growth of 17.2% and 2021 growth of 16.7% after pandemic era restrictions were largely lifted across global markets. Several airlines report plans to increase the number of operating flights this summer, the increase in capacity is expected to run counter to broader concerns about the economy but airlines insist that pent-up demand is exceeding capacity and high fares are not deterring bookings in a sign that demand for air travel will remain robust.The easing of demand growth in the coming decade along with new refining capacity growth will force refiners to reduce output favouring those with high margin complex fuels utilising their scale and profitability most effectively to limit supply growth. The volume of jet fuel in storage will be a key determinant of price levels and trend. Should stocks grow more robustly adding a larger buffer to the market, we would expect prices to continue to fall. However, our core view for refiners to limit production in response to easing margins is expected to see margins and prices supported. The margins achieved will be less than those seen in 2022 but will remain elevated above historic averages and when combined with higher Brent prices for second half of 2023 we expect jet fuel prices to stage a recovery. A key segment of jet fuel demand across the pandemic was the use of air cargo for shipping. The desire for goods over services during the worst of the lockdown periods saw manufacturers utilise air cargo to bypass the supply chain bottlenecks plaguing ports and the sector enjoy robust gains. These gains helped to support jet fuel consumption and was key source of ongoing demand. However, in recent quarters a marked slowdown in global shipping has been growing and air cargo volumes have steadily declined. The slowdown in global demand for goods will likely mean further pressure on jet fuel demand in the near-term however, the impact is likely to balance out from gains seen in previous years. Rather than a source of jet fuel demand growth we expect air cargo to steady at near pre-pandemic levels. Risks To Outlook The balance of risk to our forecast is tilted to the downside given that we expect the current price trends to reverse in the coming months as refineries reduce output. The most immediate risk to our bullish outlook for jet fuel prices is the current weakness seen in diesel consumption globally. Diesel is a key indicator of transportation and industrial activity and the slowdown in manufacturing, as premediated by the sharp rise in interest rates, has seen consumption fall and diesel stocks grow. Should refiners focus more of the middle distillate output away from diesel and into higher margin jet fuel we could see margins fall for jet fuel impacting our price forecast to the downside. In addition, should refiners fail to reduce refinery output to protect elevated margins we could see new capacity gains overwhelm markets further reducing refining margins and jet fuel prices in the quarters ahead. Below forecast air travel also pose another risk to our view for prices as weaker than forecast passenger numbers could see flight schedules reduced and lower consumption in the second half of 2023.

"2023_5";"KBC Bank - KBC Newsletter_ Economic Perspectives May 2023, Global economy.txt";"   Global economy Recent GDP figures showed that the economic environment in advanced economies is weakening as monetary tightening is starting to bite. The euro area economy grew by only 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q1, lower gas prices notwithstanding. Further rate hikes by the ECB on the back of persistently high (core) inflation will likely keep euro area growth significantly below potential . In the US, growth slowed down to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in Q1, as inventory growth turned deeply negative and consumption growth, while still contributing to growth, weakened in February and March. There, continued monetary tightening is exposing weakness in the financial sector, especially among mid-sized US banks. Four banks already went bankrupt or were taken over. First Republic Bank, the latest victim, is the largest bank failure since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Though a system-wide financial crisis is not in our base scenario, tighter lending standards are likely to contribute significantly to the slowdown of US growth in H2 2023 and in 2024. The Chinese economy, meanwhile, grew by 4.5% over a year ago, as its economy recovers from the strict zero-Covid lockdowns of 2022 and travel-related services rebounded. Nonetheless, the manufacturing and construction sectors are showing signs of weakness. Overall, our scenario expects global economic growth to slow down significantly. Furthermore, risks remain tilted to the downside as further financial sector turbulence and a potential US debt ceiling breach could further derail growth prospects. Gas prices decline, while oil prices remain surprisingly stable European gas prices declined for the fifth month in a row in April, dropping to 38 EUR per MWh, a 12% decline versus last month. Gas prices are now slightly less than the double of the pre-war levels and are 88% lower than their August peak. Europe's steady replenishment of gas reserves (and still moderate global gas demand) is the prime driver of these lower prices. EU gas reserves now stand above 60%, more than 20 percentage points higher than typical at this time of the year. This significantly lowers the risk of severe gas supply disruptions in the winter of 2024. Nonetheless, futures markets still expect gas prices to rise by around 50% to around 60 EUR per MWh by the end of the year (see figure 1). Oil prices meanwhile remained remarkably stable, with Brent prices reaching 80 USD end of April, a 2% month-on-month increase. At the start of the month, OPEC announced a 1 million barrel daily supply cut, which pushed oil prices up by 6% on the day of the announcement. However, over the course of the month, recession fears pushed prices back down. Early May, when markets went in risk-off mode, as a result of the failure of First Republic Bank, prices dropped significantly to almost 70 USD per barrel. They bounced back up, however. Oil was not the only commodity to be affected by increasing recession fears. Metal prices also declined for the fourth month in a row. Cyclical commodities such as iron ore and copper posted notable month-on-month declines of 4.5% and 8.6% respectively. Lumber, another cyclical commodity, also posted a 5.6% decline. Further down the line, positive news on global supply chains continued. Thanks to China's reopening and continued post-Covid adaptation, the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index now stands at -1.31, the lowest point since 2008. This easing pressure on global supply chains will support the global economy, while reducing inflationary pressure somewhat. Upward pressure on euro area services inflation As expected, euro area inflation rose slightly again in April, from 6.9% to 7.0%, according to the flash estimate. This was mainly the result of the small increase in energy price inflation, but fully due to a (reversed) base effect: energy prices fell more sharply in April 2022 than in April 2023 (each considered against the previous March). Both food price inflation and core inflation fell. However, the latter was exclusively accounted for by non-energy goods, whose annual rise declined from 6.6% in March to 6.2% in April. In contrast, services inflation rose slightly further from 5.1% to 5.2%. Excluding seasonal fluctuations and looking at the underlying upward dynamics over the past few months, goods inflation seems to turn (cautiously), but there appears to be renewed upward momentum in services inflation (see figure 2). The rise in inflation is widely spread across different consumer services, with outliers in tourism and hospitality. This is a not very encouraging observation, as the ongoing catch-up of wages to the recent inflation shock continues to support (or even boost) services inflation. Incidentally, there are indications that increasing profit margins in consumer-oriented service sectors contributed more than average to the increase of headline inflation in 2022. We still assume that in the coming quarters, profit margins will absorb some of the rising labour cost pressures, which will allow a cooling of services inflation and, by extension, core inflation. Moreover, sharply lower energy prices compared to the second half of 2022 will trigger a substantial fall in energy price inflation (partly due to base effects) and a broad-based easing of inflationary pressures during the second half of this year. Thus, while inflation will fall, given the recent trend in services inflation, we have nevertheless slightly raised our expectation for headline inflation in the coming months. This is reflected in the expected average inflation rate, which we have raised from 5.8% to 5.9% for 2023 and from 3.0% to 3.1% for 2024. Both headline and core US inflation decline slightly US headline inflation declined by 0.1 percentage point to 4.9% in April. A stagnation in food prices contributed strongly to the decline. Thanks to strong base effects, food price inflation declined from 8.5% to 7.6%. Meanwhile energy inflation increased by 0.6% month-on-month as gasoline prices strongly increased. Still, on a yearly basis, energy price inflation remains negative (-5.1%). Core inflation also declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.5% in April. A slowdown in shelter inflation was the main driver of this decline (see figure 3). Though this slowdown is encouraging, it remains to be seen whether it can persist. Leading indicators such as the Zillow Observed Rent Index posted strong increases in recent months. Shelter aside, goods inflation unfortunately accelerated in April to 0.6% month-on-month. The prime culprit of this acceleration were used car and truck prices. These prices had been declining for 9 straight months, but went up by 4.4% month-on-month in April. We anticipated this reversal, however. Though the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a leading indicator of this component, declined somewhat in April (-3%), it remains 6% higher than its November low. Further increases in this component in the coming months would not be surprising. Service inflation (ex. shelter) also remained high at 0.4% month-on-month. If we filter out medical care services, which again declined as a result of a methodological change, service inflation increased by 0.6% month-on-month. This high figure is not totally surprising, as wage inflation, the prime driver of service inflation, also accelerated last month. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.5% month-on-month in April. All in all, given the lower than expected food and shelter inflation, we lower both our 2023 and 2024 forecasts by 0.1 percentage point to 4.3% and 2% respectively. Central banks remain focused on inflation when setting policy rates The demise of another regional US bank, First Republic Bank, shook financial markets again as it was the largest failure since 2008. Other similar regional US banks suffered major deposit outflows and saw their share price plummet. Nonetheless, we maintain our assumption that the crisis will remain contained and temporary. This is also what central banks seem to expect. Their prime concern remains high inflation. As our scenario forecasted, both the Fed and the ECB thus raised their policy rates by 25 basis points to the range of 5%-5.25% in the US and the rate of 3.25% (deposit rate) in the euro area. In line with the Fed's hints, we confirm our view that the current level of Fed funds rate (5%-5.25%) is expected to be the peak of this rate hiking cycle. We should also keep in mind that the Fed is operating its QT operation of reducing its balance sheet at the cruising pace of 95 billion USD per month, resulting in continued monetary tightening even at an unchanged policy rate. Our view with respect to the peak of the US rate cycle is consistent with the bulk of current market expectations. However, compared to market expectations, our view on the timing of the first rate cut differs. In our scenario, the Fed will maintain its current rate until end 2023. Consistent with our US macroeconomic scenario, which incorporates a technical recession in the second half of 2023 and a notable increase of the unemployment rate from the current historically low level, the Fed will probably start its rate-cutting cycle in the first quarter of 2024. The ECB, on the other hand, still has more ground to cover. After the expected rate hike in early May, we except two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each, bringing the deposit rate to its terminal rate of 3.75%. In contrast to market expectations, we expect the ECB the maintain its peak rate until well into 2024. Finally, at its May meeting, the ECB also announced that it expects to end the reinvestments under its asset purchase programme (APP) from July on. The implied monthly pace would, at least at the start, be broadly comparable to the current pace of 15 billion EUR per month. Consistent with the confirmation of our monetary policy scenario, we maintain our view on long-term bond yields. In the short term, bond yields still have some upward potential, somewhat reducing the current strong inversion of the yield curve. This is, in our view, particularly the case in the euro area, where long-term real yields are still relatively low. After peaking by the end of the second quarter, bond yields are likely to gradually decline. During the past month, intra-EMU spreads remained broadly stable. We confirm our view that these spreads will continue to moderately and gradually normalise from still fundamentally low levels in the context of the ongoing tightening of monetary policy. The ECB's flexible reinvestment policy of its PEPP (over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions) and the availability of the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), if needed, should be sufficient to ensure that this spread normalisation continues in an orderly manner. Finally, our view on the euro exchange rate has become slightly more optimistic for the coming quarters. Now that it has become likely that the Fed's rate hiking cycle may be coming to an end, while the ECB still has some way to go, the euro is likely to appreciate gradually versus the US dollar, and reach 1.13 USD per EUR at the end of 2023. Even at that level, we would consider the euro to be relatively undervalued compared to its long-term fundamental value.

"2023_5";"Opec -Plus Wins This Week's Price Tug of War.txt";" Oil futures managed modest gains over the week as the tug of war between Opec-plus and the US Federal Reserve continued. Opec-plus production fell to its lowest level in 11 months in April, according to Energy Intelligence analysis. The slump was attributed to sharp declines in Russia and Iraq and comes ahead of the groupâ€™s recently announced 1.67 barrel per day output cut due to start in May. International benchmark Brent gained $2.48 per barrel last week to finish at $74.98/bbl Thursday.  US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate put on $2.31/bbl to close at $70.87/bbl. Brent has still shed $12/bbl in the last month as demand-denting US interest rate hikes have largely overshadowed the Opec-plus supply-side management. Prices had slumped again midweek after higher US consumer prices in April suggested the Fed would look to hike interest rates again. The inflation warning came as US crude oil inventories rose by a surprise 3 million bbl, with the uneven pace of Chinaâ€™s Covid-19 recovery also providing fodder for market bears. China has issued another batch of product export quotas, almost doubling its potential overseas fuel sales compared to the same period of last year. That could be taken as a sign of domestic demand weakness. However, the latest round of permits to sell an additional 9 million tons of jet fuel, diesel and gasoline was less than half the 19 million tons awarded previously. China's refiners have been the welcome recipients of large volumes of cheap Russian crude after sanctions pushed it out of Europe and are making plenty of fuel. European jet cargo premiums were steady at a near-$50 per metric ton premium to ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures as imports keep pace with rising summer demand. Well-placed suppliers peg current European airline fuel demand at around 86% of 2019 levels or roughly 1.15 million b/d. The estimate comes amid warnings that airline fuel demand could struggle to go much above 90% of pre-pandemic levels this summer due to bottlenecks in Europeâ€™s fuel supply infrastructure. Imports are not expected to be the problem, which is linked to the already-stretched network of pipelines, barges, trucks and railcars used to move fuel inland. Traders say that labor shortages are the primary bottleneck. Gasoil prices have flattened out over the summer in a sign market anxiety over diesel supplies without Russia could be waning. A glut of fuel is weighing on prompt prices. Buyers are asking for certificates of origin amid fears Russian fuel is being sold in Europe with fake bills of lading. No jet fuel cargoes traded in Europeâ€™s pricing window last week. Airline fuel suppliers BP and TotalEnergies appeared on the buy side late in the week for early-June volumes into Le Havre. Saudi Aramco and trader Glencore both offered cargoes into Rotterdam. Aramco named the LR2 Navig8 Passion bringing fuel from both its Jubail and Rabigh refineries in Saudi Arabia. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp fell for the first time in four weeks despite a tanker discharging from Kuwait. At 916,000 tons on May 11, according to Insights Global, tanks are now 17% above year-earlier levels. Tanks repeatedly went above 1.2 million tons during the pandemic. Eurocontrol reckons regional air traffic is already 92% of 2019 levels, but traders point out that many fuel-hungry long-haul flights are still missing. US jet markets sprang back to life with a surge in demand to more than 1.9 million b/d in the week ended May 5, according to weekly government data. Refinery output is lagging behind the jump in deliveries, with production averaging 1.65 million b/d even as refinery utilization tops 90%. The downstream sector has shifted into gasoline mode as middle distillates lose their luster. Jet imports also receded to just 88,000 b/d in early May, down from 140,000 b/d over the last four weeks. The imbalance took a chunk out of nationwide stocks, which fell by 700,000 bbl to 39.9 million bbl â€ some 4% above the year-ago mark when demand was 5% lower. Stronger refining margins for gasoline are driving the switch to motor fuels. The Energy Intelligence downstream model shows gasoline crack spreads in a Gulf Coast refinery rising to $27.45/bbl in the week ended May 5, versus $25/bbl for low-sulfur diesel and $18 for jet fuel. The futures market also attests to tightness. Nymex gasoline futures post a 10Â?/gallon premium to diesel, and the forward curve is in backwardation. Front-month gasoline trades almost 14Â? above its three-month counterpart. Diesel cracks stole the spotlight for a prolonged period, but are now on the wane. This has affected the traditional flow of gasoline from Europe to the US Northeast as European refiners shifted to maximize diesel yield for domestic markets or cut utilization in the aftermath of the Ukraine war. Asian jet markets reversed course and trended lower, even though the benchmark Singapore spot price differential briefly rose to a two-month high. Prompt jet fuel demand is under pressure from shrinking air traffic in four of the largest regional aviation markets East of Suez. Singapore price differentials rose to a 75Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on May 9, its highest level since Mar. 8. It subsequently tumbled to a 47Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on May 11 for an 11Â? decline on the week. A total of 100,000 bbl of end-May to early June-loading jet traded from May 5-11 in the Platts Singapore trading window. Saudi Aramco sold the entire volume in one lot on May 10 to Vitol at parity to Singapore quotes. Scheduled airline capacity for the week of May 8 dropped by nearly 2% in the largest regional Northeast Asian market, which includes China, according to OAG.

"2023_5";"Pacific Snapshot_ Japan 's Reopening Revitalizes Demand.txt";"    Japanese refiners more than doubled their imports of bonded jet fuel late last year to prepare for the country's reopening after the government lifted Covid-19 travel restrictions. The need for more supplies to fuel international flights pushed bonded imports up to 41,000 b/d in November and December, a fivefold increase from October levels. Refiners had stopped bringing in bonded volumes after Tokyo imposed lockdown measures three years ago. The restart of international flights revived Japan's jet fuel demand. Consumption surged back to 200,000 b/d in December and January â€ a 25% increase from year-ago levels. Refiners boosted jet output to 156,000 b/d in January to keep pace with higher demand, lifting stocks above 5 million bbl. Japanese stocks of burning kerosene continued to decline after reaching a 19 million bbl peak in November. Page 2 of 2 Pacific Snapshot: Japan 's Reopening Revitalizes Demand        "
"2023_5";"Summer Buying Lifts Oil Prices.txt";"   Resurgent fuel demand pushed oil prices higher. A supply crunch is looming with the International Energy Agency this week warning that oil balances will tighten by a dramatic 2 million barrels per day in the second half of this year. Closely watched US gasoline demand is already running at its highest level since 2021 with global jet fuel demand also about to take off. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) this week told airlines to prepare for a busy summer holiday season with bookings already 35% higher in the first quarter than last year.  â€?Expectations are high for this yearâ€™s peak Northern summer travel season. For many this will be their first post-pandemic travel experience,â€ said Nick Careen, IATAâ€™s senior vice president for operations, safety and security. â€?All industry players now need to deliver,â€ he urged. Airline bookings were up by 135% in Asia-Pacific, 43% in the Middle East, 40% in Europe, 36% in Africa, 21% in Latin America and 14% in North America. International oil benchmark Brent finished the week 88Â? per barrel higher at $75.86/bbl, while US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate gained 99Â?/bbl to close at $71.86/bbl. Europeâ€™s benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures failed to keep pace with crude despite uncertainty around diesel supplies. Brussels is mulling a ban on tankers suspected of bringing illegal Russian diesel back to Europe. That would include ships that have previously carried Russian fuel in breach of G7 rules, tankers involved in dubious ship-to-ship transfers in EU waters and vessels that have turned off their transponders to hide their location and movements. Some â€?origin-swappingâ€ of Russian diesel was expected, but the volumes of fuel labeled as non-Russian coming back to Europe are so high as to draw suspicion. Arrivals also include vast amounts of diesel and jet fuel made from Russian crude in India, which is perfectly legal under current EU rules, but was still being discussed at this weekâ€™s G7 meeting in Japan. Europe imported a record 585,000 metric tons of jet fuel from India in April, according to Kpler tanker tracking, with May volumes also pegged at a historically high 415,000 tons. Diesel imports from India were also at a record 800,000 tons in April. Jet fuel cargo premiums slipped $6/ton to $42.75/ton over front-month ICE LSGO futures over the week on bumper imports. Total arrivals nudged 1.9 million tons last month with a further 1.25 million tons already expected in May. No jet cargoes were traded in the public pricing window this week. Bids from BP and TotalEnergies were too far apart from offers from Aramco Trading and Shell. European air traffic is only 7% below pre-pandemic levels, according to network manager Eurocontrol. US jet fuel markets are tightening on stronger airline fuel demand. Implied jet demand over the last four weeks to May 12 is up by more than 4% year on year at 1.6 million b/d, according to the latest Department of Energy figures. Buying slipped to 1.4 million b/d last week having struck 1.9 million b/d in the last week of April. Refiners are emerging from seasonal maintenance with utilization rates back above 90% nationwide and jet production running at 1.7 million b/d. US jet fuel inventories have been comfortably above the 40 million bbl mark for three out of the last four weeks, rising to 41.6 million bbl by May 12. US jet exports also perked up, rising to their highest levels since early March at 179,000 b/d. The US West Coast jet market could tighten significantly later this year, warn traders, when the already import-dependent market loses yet more refining capacity. Phillips 66 is planning to take the remaining units of its Rodeo, California, refinery off line ahead of the plant's conversion to renewable fuels. Meanwhile, refiners in some parts of Asia-Pacific are considering economic run cuts. Incremental demand in China could also be strong enough to absorb not only incremental runs from new refineries but also some product exports. That would tighten the entire Pacific Basin. Asia's jet market weakened significantly, with the benchmark Singapore spot price differential sinking to its lowest premium in seven months. Prompt jet demand is flagging with air traffic down in two out of four regional markets. Cargoes were pegged at an 11Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on May 17, their weakest since last October. A slight recovery to 15Â?/bbl over quotes by May 18 still represented a 32Â?/bbl loss on the week. Two cargo lots changed hands in the pricing window. PetroChina sold 100,000 bbl to China Aviation Oil (CAO) at a discount of 10Â?/bbl to Singapore quotes on May 15. CAO sold 100,000 bbl to Total at a 30Â?/bbl premium the same day. Scheduled airline capacity fell by 0.5% in the giant Northeast Asia market, which includes China in the week of May 15, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. Capacity also dipped by 0.6% in the Mideast, but rose by 0.1% in Southeast Asia and 1.2% in South Asia, according to OAG. Page 2 of 3 Summer Buying Lifts Oil Prices        "
"2023_5";"The Global Economy, Resilience And Security.txt";"  ... Earlier this month, I told the US Congress that our best estimate is that the United States government will be unable to continue to satisfy all of its obligations by early June - and potentially as early as June 1 - if Congress does not address the debt limit before that time. That projection underscores the urgent need for Congress to act as soon as possible. In my assessment - and that of economists across the board - a default on US obligations would produce an economic and financial catastrophe. Millions of Americans could lose their jobs. Household incomes would be reduced. American businesses would see credit markets deteriorate. And millions of American families that receive government payments would likely be left without the resources that they were promised. This would make it dramatically harder for households to spend and businesses to invest. A default would threaten the gains that we've worked so hard to make over the past few years in our pandemic recovery. And it would spark a global downturn that would set us back much further. It would also risk undermining US global economic leadership and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests. Short of a default, brinksmanship over the debt limit can also impose serious economic costs. We know this from recent history. As we learned in 2011, just the serious threat of default can lead to a downgrade of our credit rating and a weakening of consumer confidence. We could see a rise in interest rates drive up payments on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. We are already seeing spikes in interest rates for debt due around the date that the debt limit may bind. There is no good reason to generate a crisis of our own making. The US Congress has raised or suspended the debt limit about 80 times since 1960. I urge it to act quickly to do so once again. G7 priorities Let me now turn to our work at the G7. I'd first like to thank Finance Minister Suzuki and his team for hosting the G7 Ministerial. And thank you to Japan for its leadership of our group this year. There are many issues that we will work on this week. But today, I would like to highlight three of my core priorities. The first is the global macroeconomy. We are taking a broad range of individual and joint actions to bring down inflation, sustain growth, and help mitigate the impact of external shocks, including to developing countries. The second is to redouble our commitment to support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia. And the third is our longer-term work to bolster economic resilience and security. As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working not only with my colleagues from the G7 - but those from several non-G7 partners that are here this week, including developing countries and emerging markets. We all have shared goals. I look forward to productive discussions about how we can better deliver for all. Global economy First, even as we face downside risks, I believe that the global economy remains in a better place than many predicted six months ago. In most G7 countries - including the United States - annual headline inflation has fallen in recent months. And the growth outlook for the global economy is better than it was in the fall. In the United States, we have taken decisive action to tackle elevated inflation and strengthen confidence in the banking system, while also enacting a trifecta of historic legislation to raise our long-term growth potential. Other countries have taken actions to address their near-term challenges as well. We encourage our partners to make long-term investments in their productivity and in combating climate change. When we strengthen our own economies, we strengthen the global economy as well. But we need to do more. It's important that we take concerted actions to improve the economic outlook for the entire world - particularly in developing countries. That's why we will coordinate on our efforts to push hard for timely and comprehensive debt treatments for countries in debt distress. And it's why we have worked hard to take joint actions to lower food and energy costs during a volatile period. Many of these actions have had the largest impact on the poorest countries. Of course, we remain attuned to economic headwinds and downside risks. The world was still recovering from the pandemic when Russia began its illegal full-scale war against Ukraine. These shocks continue to impose significant costs on the global economy. Further, markets are seeing the possibility of a US debt limit breach as a growing downside risk. I will continue to work with my counterparts on ways to strengthen the global economy over the next few days - and beyond. Russia's illegal war against Ukraine Second, I look forward to coordinating with other G7 members to support Ukraine and degrade Russia's ability to wage war. When the G7 finance ministers gathered together last spring, Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine was less than three months old. Now, the war is approaching its 450th day. Since Day One, our countries have stood united to support the Ukrainian people as they have mounted a fierce resistance. The United States is proud to have provided significant economic, security, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. And we are just as proud to be part of a broad coalition that has stepped up to assist Ukraine in its moment of need. We are pleased that the IMF's program for Ukraine will provide critical financing for the country while putting it on a path of macroeconomic stabilization and future recovery. The program will bolster President Zelenskyy's commitment to accountability and good governance. And it will help Ukraine's economic officials provide a steady hand for its economy and reform agenda in the coming months and years. We are also continuing to lead a multilateral coalition of over 30 countries to impose heavy economic costs on Russia for its war. Over the past year, our campaign has systematically degraded Russia's military-industrial complex and helped reduce the revenues that Russia can use to fund its war. Because these sanctions are having an impact, Russia is trying to get around them. This year, a central piece of our strategy is to take further actions to disrupt Russia's attempts to evade our sanctions. Our three-pronged approach involves improving information sharing and coordination among our allies and partners; putting pressure on companies and jurisdictions that we know are allowing or facilitating evasion; and identifying and shutting down specific channels used by Russia to equip and fund its military. We have taken a wave of actions in the past few months to crack down on evasion. And my team has travelled around the world to intensify this work. Our innovative policies to support Ukraine extend to our joint efforts to restrict Russian oil export revenues. Last May, the G7 finance ministers discussed the price cap policy for the first time. Our goals were two-fold: to reduce revenues for the Kremlin while helping stabilize global energy markets. A few months into its implementation, we see clear signs that the price cap is working. The Russian government's oil revenues from January through March of this year were over 40 percent lower than a year prior. And importantly, global oil markets have remained relatively stable since the imposition of the crude oil cap last December. In short, the price cap has helped stabilize the global economy just as it has hurt Russia's ability to wage its illegal war. Members of the price cap coalition are committed to prohibiting or phasing out imports of Russian oil. But we continue to urge developing countries to save on their oil costs by taking advantage of the price cap to negotiate steep bargains on Russian oil. As I've said before, we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Economic resilience and security Third, I will work with my counterparts on our longer-term initiative to build greater economic resilience and bolster economic security. Our goal is not only to enhance resilience for ourselves. It is also to build resilience for our allies and partners - including developing countries around the world. We are advancing important work to build reliable and secure critical supply chains. This is part of an effort that I have called""friendshoring."" We also believe that our supply-chain diversification efforts can open up more trade and investment opportunities for developing countries that have traditionally only had limited footprints in global supply chains. During the upcoming G7 meetings, I am looking forward to discussing ways to partner with developing countries to help them better integrate into global trade - in a way that moves countries away from solely extractive industries into activities that provide greater support for the domestic economy and employment. This work will build on the investments already underway through the G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. Our partnership is already helping bolster global supply chains by mobilizing private capital toward infrastructure projects in developing countries. We also look forward to building on our work with about a dozen countries through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that was launched this time last year in Japan. The G7 will also advance our work to mitigate geostrategic risks in our economies. As I said in a speech last month, the United States has a broad suite of tools to mitigate risks to our national security. And we will take narrowly targeted actions when necessary. We are looking forward to working with the G7 to effectively counter-economic coercion, which is a key focus of Japan's presidency. We also know that many of the threats to economic resilience are coming from the global challenges that we all face. Since last fall, the United States has worked with shareholders to evolve the multilateral development banks to better combat 21st-century global challenges. Transboundary challenges like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict are disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable among us. We are accelerating the momentum for our evolution initiative and aim to adopt a rolling set of World Bank reforms over the coming months. These G7 meetings present us with an opportunity to coordinate our collaboration with and support for lower-income countries.  Page 2 of 3 The Global Economy, Resilience And Security        "
"2023_5";"What next for the global economy_.txt";"World Economic Forum has issued the following press release: The World Economic Forum's Growth Summit 2023 is taking place 2-3 May in Geneva, Switzerland.This year's summit revolves around the theme of 'Jobs and Opportunity for All'.The Chief Economists Briefing session looked at the prospects for the global economy, from recession to emerging markets and structural challenges.Paul Donovan, Chief Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management; Gregory Daco, Chief Economist at EY-Parthenon; Sandra Phlippen, Chief Economist at ABN AMRO; and Svenja Gudell, Chief Economist at Indeed Inc, joined John Defterios, a Professor of Business at New York University Abu Dhabi, to look at the prospects for the global economy. Against a backdrop of sluggish growth, high inflation and markets hit by crises, the Chief Economists Briefing looked to the future and the possible causes for optimism. Here are some of the key highlights and for more read the Forum's latest Chief Economists Outlook. Today's session look at the impact of supply shocks. Image: World Economic ForumThe prospects of a recessionPaul Donovan explained that he doesn't like the term recession and we need to reconsider how we measure it, but, he said that he doesn't think there'll be a major downturn in major economies because the middle class will keep things going. As Sandra Phlippen explained, households have better cash buffers than firms, and the US is in better shape than Europe. She doesn't believe it will be a 'really deep recession'. Meanwhile, Gregory Daco stressed that the consumer fundamentals are good in the US. But, in terms of the prospects for a recession, it's hard to tell, because we're in a multi-speed economy, he added. Have you read?Chief Economists Outlook: May 2023Growth Summit 2023 Day 2: Here's everything you need to knowGrowth Summit 2023 Day 1: Here's everything you need to knowThe impact of inflation and interest ratesPaul Donovan explained at the phases of inflation, arguing that we have a profit-margin-led inflation episode - which is unusual. There are a number of signs that inflation is cooling in the US though, added Gregory Daco. There are data issues, though, added Svenja Gudell. It's been difficult to get a good angle on what's going on because of the data quality, she said. There were also calls for the Fed to pause rate rises and to wait and see the effect of prior tightening. Gregory Daco thought it unlikely here will be a pause this time, though. Structural challengesThere are cyclical and structural challenges facing the global economy, including in its efforts to tackle inflation, explained Gregory Daco. Svenja Gudell agreed with the impact of structural changes, in particular ageing populations, which will have a major impact on the production - both what is produced and the cost. Emerging economiesWe shouldn't overlook the impact on emerging economies, the panel stressed. The fiscal stimulus in the United States during the pandemic has had a particular cost to emerging economies, Sandra Phlippen said, without any of the benefits. There have been waves of supply shocks, too, explained Gregory Daco. These include, for example, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Emerging markets tend to be at the losing end of supply shocks, both in terms of supply but, also the inflationary impact.  Page 2 of 2 What next for the global economy?        "
"2023_6";"Asia seen as bright spot in green jet fuel market.txt";"    Global consumption of sustain­able aviation fuel made from non- fossil materials could exceed 12 million tonnes annually by 2030, and the Asia-Pacific is a market with huge potential, according  to Neste, the world's largest ­producer of green jet fuel.  Governments could help encourage its use by outlining clear targets for the percentage  of sustainable aviation fuel that should be blended with fossil- based jet fuel, said Sami Jauhiainen, vice-president of Asia-Pacific renewable aviation at the Finnish oil refining group.  ""In the Asia-Pacific, some countries have already published clear targets, like Japan with a 10 per cent blending goal by 2030,"" he said. ""In China, it is more ­difficult [to project] because there is no clear target.""  Given that jet-fuel consumption on the mainland and in Hong Kong was just over 40 million tonnes a year before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, there was a potential market of several million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel annually if ­similar targets were established, he said.  ""We see a lot of potential to grow,"" Jauhiainen said. ""Hong Kong is the world's largest cargo hub, while China is the world's second-largest aviation market after the United States with a strong growth outlook.""  The Civil Aviation Administration of China, under  a green development policy and action plan published last December, aims for cumulative consumption of green jet fuel to reach 50,000 tonnes by 2025. It did not provide annual targets.  Neste had been in discussions with airlines and fuel distribution firms to supply to a growing number of airports in the  Asia-Pacific, Jauhiainen said, adding sales in the region had begun in 2020, covering Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Australia and Hong Kong on a pilot basis.  Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific Airways had bought Neste's product last year through Shell, he added.  Globally, aviation consumed around 300 million tonnes of jet fuel in 2019, which is worth US$218 billion at the  current market price, according to S&P Global Platts. Sustainable aviation fuel  amounted to just 0.1 per cent of the total that year.  Aviation accounts for just over 2 per cent of global energy-related carbon emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.  ""The key challenge is the  cost of sustainable aviation fuel, which is three to five times more expensive. Hence it is difficult for airlines to justify its use if their competitors are not required to  do the same,"" Jauhiainen said.  Page 2 of 2 Asia seen as bright spot in green jet fuel market        "

Global growth is projected to decelerate from 3.1% in 2022 to 2.1% in 2023. In EMDEs other than China, growth [...] Washing DC, US//—Global growth has slowed sharply and the risk of financial stress in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is intensifying amid elevated global interest rates, according to the World Bank's latest Global Economic Prospects report. Global growth is projected to decelerate from 3.1% in 2022 to 2.1% in 2023. In EMDEs other than China, growth is set to slow to 2.9% this year from 4.1% last year. These forecasts reflect broad-based downgrades: growth projections for 70 percent of EMDEs and nearly all advanced economies have been downgraded. ""The surest way to reduce poverty and spread prosperity is through employment—and slower growth makes job creation a lot harder,"" World Bank Group President Ajay Banga said. ""It's important to keep in mind that growth forecasts are not destiny. We have an opportunity to turn the tide but it will take us all working together."" Most EMDEs have seen only limited harm from the recent banking stress in advanced economies so far, but they are now sailing in dangerous waters. With increasingly restrictive global credit conditions, one out of every four EMDEs has effectively lost access to international bond markets. The squeeze is especially acute for EMDEs with underlying vulnerabilities such as low creditworthiness. Growth projections for these economies for 2023 are less than half those from a year ago, making them highly vulnerable to additional shocks. ""The world economy is in a precarious position,"" Indermit Gill, the World Bank Group's Chief Economist and Senior Vice President said. ""Outside of East and South Asia, it is a long way from the dynamism needed to eliminate poverty, counter climate change, and replenish human capital. In 2023, trade will grow at less than a third of its pace in the years before the pandemic. In emerging markets and developing economies, debt pressures are growing due to higher interest rates. Fiscal weaknesses have already tipped many low-income countries into debt distress. Meanwhile, the financing needs to achieve the sustainable development goals are far greater than even the most optimistic projections of private investment."" The latest forecasts indicate that the overlapping shocks of the pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the sharp slowdown amid tight global financial conditions have dealt an enduring setback to development in EMDEs, one that will persist for the foreseeable future. By the end of 2024, economic activity in these economies is expected be about 5% below levels projected on the eve of the pandemic. In low-income countries—especially the poorest—the damage is stark: in more than one-third of these countries, per capita incomes in 2024 will still be below 2019 levels. This feeble pace of income growth will entrench extreme poverty in many low-income countries. ""Many developing economies are struggling to cope with weak growth, persistently high inflation, and record debt levels. Yet new hazards—such as the possibility of more widespread spillovers from renewed financial stress in advanced economies—could make matters even worse for them,"" Ayhan Kose, Deputy Chief Economist of the World Bank Group said. ""Policy makers in these economies should act promptly to prevent financial contagion and reduce near-term domestic vulnerabilities."" In advanced economies, growth is set to decelerate from 2.6% in 2022 to 0.7% this year and remain weak in 2024, the report says. After growing 1.1% in 2023, the U.S. economy is set to decelerate to 0.8% in 2024, mainly because of the lingering impact of the sharp rise in interest rates over the past year and a half. In the euro area, growth is forecast to slow to 0.4% in 2023 from 3.5% in 2022, due to the lagged effect of monetary policy tightening and energy-price increases. The report also offers an analysis of how increases in U.S. interest rates are affecting EMDEs. Most of the rise in two-year Treasury yields over the past year and a half has been driven by investor expectations of hawkish U.S. monetary policy to control inflation. According to the report, this particular type of interest rate increases is associated with adverse financial effects in EMDEs, including a higher probability of financial crisis. Moreover, these effects are more pronounced in countries with greater economic vulnerabilities. In particular, frontier markets—those with less developed financial markets and more limited access to international capital—tend to see outsized increases in borrowing costs; for instance, sovereign risk spreads in frontier markets tend to rise by more than three times as much as those in other EMDEs. In addition, the report provides a comprehensive assessment of the fiscal policy challenges confronting low-income economies. These countries are in dire straits. Rising interest rates have compounded the deterioration in their fiscal positions over the past decade. Public debt now averages about 70% of GDP. Interest payments are eating up a rising share of limited government revenues. 14 low-income countries are already in, or at high risk of, debt distress. Spending pressures have risen in these economies. Adverse shocks such as extreme climate events and conflict are more likely to tip households into distress in low-income countries than anywhere else because of limited social safety nets. On average, these countries spend just 3% of GDP on their most vulnerable citizens—well below the 26% average for developing economies.

"2023_6";"Global economy 'to expand just 2.1%'.txt";"  THE global economy is likely slowing sharply this year, hobbled by high interest rates, the repercussions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic. That is the latest outlook of the World Bank, a 189-country antipoverty agency, which estimates that the international economy will expand just 2.1% in 2023 after growing 3.1% in 2022. But the bank's latest Global Economic Prospects report, which it issued yesterday, marks an upgrade from its previous forecast in January. That estimate envisioned worldwide growth of just 1.7% this year. The Federal Reserve and other major central banks have been aggressively raising interest rates to combat a resurgence of inflation, set off by a stronger-than-expected rebound from the pandemic recession, persistent supply shortages and energy and food price shocks caused by the Ukraine war. In its report yesterday, the World Bank upgraded its forecast for US economic growth this year to 1.1%. Though weak, that is more than double the growth the World Bank envisioned in January. The eurozone, which represents the 20 countries that share the euro currency, is expected to post collective growth of 0.4% this year. That, too, marks a slight upgrade. In January, the World Bank had expected no growth at all for the eurozone this year.  Page 2 of 2 Global economy 'to expand just 2.1%'        "

Following growth of 3.1% last year, the global economy will slow to 2.1% in 2023, the World Bank said on Tuesday in its latest forecast.   The figure for 2023 was however 0.4 percentage points higher than an estimate released by the bank in January.   It is still one of the weakest growth rates in the past five decades, said the World Bank's chief economist Indermit Gill.   ""The world economy is in a precarious position,"" Gill said.  In 2024, the global economy should recover slightly and grow by 2.4%, according to the report. However, growth could also be lower than expected.  High global inflation is expected to decline gradually as demand eases and commodity prices weaken, the report said.   It could also lead to further tightening of monetary policy. Widespread bank stress could lead to much weaker growth outcomes.   ""It's important to keep in mind that growth forecasts are not destiny,"" World Bank President Ajay Banga said.

"2023_6";"KBC Bank - KBC Newsletter_ Economic Perspectives June 2023, Global economy.txt";" Global economy Calamity averted, but economic concerns are far from over The global economy was being held hostage by US politicians in May. Some of them were willing to risk a ruinous default of the world's biggest economy in order to score political points. Luckily, reason prevailed and an agreement to raise the debt ceiling for around two years was found, lifting the issue over the 2024 presidential election. That does not mean that the global economy is out of the woods yet. On the contrary, all major economies are showing signs of weakening. Producer sentiment indicators in Europe are weakening across sectors and countries. The German economy even officially entered in a recession. The US economy is also buckling under monetary pressure, while exports declined dramatically in April. Meanwhile the post-Covid recovery is losing steam in China, as industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investments disappoint.

Central bank efforts to control rampant inflation risk tipping some of the worldâ€™s biggest oil consumers in the US and Europe into recession. International benchmark Brent shed $1.53 per barrel over the week to close at $74.14/bbl Thursday, while US domestic price-pin WTI lost $1.11/bbl to finish at $69.51/bbl. Prices are now lower than before Opec-plus linchpin Saudi Arabia elected to take more oil off the market in a bid to shore up prices.  The UKâ€™s Bank of England hiked interest rates for the 13 th month in a row to 5% Thursday. Rates are now the highest since the financial crash in 2008. US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress that US interest rates could rise twice more this year taking them close to 6%. Implied US oil demand is still growing for now, reaching 21 million barrels per day last week, up more than 1 million b/d from the same time last year. A sharp fall in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp gasoil inventories supported middle distillate prices in Europe. Diesel and heating oil tanks fell by 9.5% on the week, according to Insight Global. Both imports and local refinery production failed to keep pace with even sluggish regional demand. At 2.04 million tons on Jun. 22, ARA gasoil stocks are now at almost a six-month low. Sources say fuel shortages have lengthened waiting times for barges loading at ARA terminals to almost a week. Drought is also playing havoc with inland fuel movements with low river levels forcing barges to carry barely half-loads. Front-month ICE low sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures were unchanged on the week while premiums for both diesel and jet fuel cargoes both strengthened. Jet is much better supplied than diesel with a steady stream of East of Suez imports helping offset a spate of local refinery issues. High diesel margins had persuaded fuel producers to delay much needed maintenance. Jet tanks in ARA were barely changed at 826,000 tons after a tanker arrived from the United Arab Emirates. Europeâ€™s jet market is still in contango despite underlying gasoil backwardation, as the market prepares for peak summer demand. The week saw two jet cargo trades in the pricing window. European heavyweight BP bought fuel into Le Havre Jul. 5-9 from Swiss trader Vitol last Friday at a $39 per ton premium to July ICE LSGO futures. BP bought again from Glencore in Mondayâ€™s window, this time into Rotterdam Jun. 30-Jul. 4 at July plus $36/ton. Regional air traffic is running around 8% below pre-pandemic levels so far this summer season. That's still a vast improvement on the stubborn 15% deficit seen last year. Fuel demand has been slower to recover with many long-haul flights still missing and more older less fuel-efficient aircraft now retired. US jet markets continued to gyrate as oil fundamentals faced off against macroeconomic forces. On Wednesday, oil prices jumped as US corn and soybean prices raced to multi-month highs, raising expectations that crop shortfalls around the globe could lower biofuels blending and increase oil demand. Chicago Board of Trade corn futures rose 5.2% on Wednesday after a government report showed that dry conditions were stressing much of the US crop as it neared key development phases, traders said. ""The grain markets are starting to realize that inventories are low, and it'll only be a matter of time before the oil market wakes up to that fact,"" one analyst said. Diesel refinery cracks have been sliding since the start of the year after a spectacularly profitable war-driven 2022, a mild Northern Hemisphere winter, an unexpected abundance of supplies from Russia and rising exports from China. Gasoline had become the favorite for refiners, but the tide is starting to turn. Jet fuel demand is rising fast as the summer travel season takes over and battling with diesel for molecules from the middle distillate pool. Jet usage surged by nearly 20% to 1.8 million b/d in the week ended Jun. 16, according to EIA data. Refiners boosted output to 1.74 million b/d but more supply is needed to offset a slide in jet imports, which fell to just 86,000 b/d over the last four weeks. By mid-June, jet fuel margins had climbed back to nearly $25 per barrel and diesel cracks reached $29, the Energy Intelligence refinery model shows. The US is adding 365,000 b/d refined products output, boosted by the end of maintenance and the startup of the Exxon Mobil 250,000 b/d Baytown refinery. That could help ease the competition between jet fuel and diesel in the refinery slate. Asian jet markets weakened even as a deal was done in the Singapore trading window at a higher spot premium. The softness defied a rise in overall air traffic in the four largest regional aviation markets East of Suez. Singapore price differentials sank by 9Â?/bbl to a 3Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Jun. 21 â€ its lowest level since Jun. 1. A total of 100,000 bbl of July-loading jet traded from Jun. 16-22 in the Singapore Platts trading window. The entire volume was sold in one lot by Unipec on Jun. 20 to BP at a 30Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes. Airline capacity has been rising in Northeast Asia and the Mideast, offsetting a minor decline in South Asia, according to OAG data. Page 2 of 3 Macroeconomic Gloom Knocks Down Oil Prices        "
"2023_6";"OECD sees limited improvement in global economic growth.txt";"  The global economy is set for a precarious recovery this year and next, as it continues to deal with the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Wednesday. The Paris-based OECD's latest Economic Outlook said the United States, Europe, and China will experience the same relative sluggishness in their recoveries. “The global economy is turning a corner but faces a long road ahead to attain strong and sustainable growth. Global economic developments have begun to improve, but the upturn remains fragile,” it said. Dogged by persistent inflation and the restrictive policies of major central banks seeking to contain price pressures, the world economy is set to grow 2.7 per cent this year, slightly up from its March forecast of 2.6 per cent. In 2024, growth will pick up marginally to 2.9 per cent, which means both years are expected to remain below the 3.4 per cent average seen in the seven years before the pandemic. The organisation says despite the moderate improvement, higher interest rates will weigh on growth, banks, and markets, while inflation will continue to drag on household spending. Economists had predicted that the outlook would remain subdued because of inflation, concerns about energy security, and the ongoing war in Ukraine. The OECD sees inflation declining to 5.2 per cent by year-end from 7.8 per cent at the end of last year in the Group of 20 countries that make up more than 80 per cent of the global economy. Europe's rate should fall to 3.5 per cent. Those levels would provide some relief but are still above the 2 per cent inflation targets for the European Central Bank which has been rapidly raising interest rates to fight inflation. It cautioned that while central banks need to maintain policies that restrict credit, they “must keep a watchful eye, given the uncertainties around the exact impact"" of the rapid hikes. The OECD’s outlook was however more optimistic than that of the World Bank. On Tuesday, citing similar risks, it raised its forecast for world growth this year to 2.1% but cut back expectations for 2024 to 2.4 per cent from a previous 2.7 per cent forecast.

"2023_6";"Pacific Snapshot_ Japan 's Reopening Awakens Asian Jet Markets.txt";"   Japan's re-opening following three years of lockdown measures shook Asian jet fuel markets awake. Japanese jet fuel demand soared by 50% from the year-earlier month to nearly 200,000 b/d in February. Bonded fuel used on international flights accounted for most of the gain. Usage of bonded fuel jumped by 70% to 142,000 b/d to recapture nearly three quarters of the Japanese market. Domestic fuel sales were 12% lower than year-earlier rates at some 58,000 b/d as passengers opted for trips abroad. Refiners boosted their imports of bonded fuel to 51,000 b/d to meet the demand surge. They also boosted jet yields to produce 178,000 b/d. Tank levels fell to 4.9 million bbl as refiners took supply out of inventory â€ 4% below the year-ago mark.  Page 2 of 2 Pacific Snapshot: Japan 's Reopening Awakens Asian Jet Markets        "
"2023_6";"Prices Lose Altitude Ahead of Opec Meeting.txt";" Opec-plus ministers face another tricky decision when they meet in Vienna this weekend. An uncertain outlook for the global economy â€ with much of the West on the brink of recession â€ pushed Brent crude futures below $75 per barrel this week. The International benchmark closed at $74.28/bbl Thursday, down $1.98/bbl on the week, while US domestic price-pin WTI lost $1.73/bbl to finish at $70.10/bbl. Options on the table range from a rollover of previously agreed production cuts to a deal that takes additional barrels off the market.  The producer group already cut output by 2 million barrels per day last October, plus another 1.66 b/d unexpected voluntary curb revealed in early April. Russia has voiced a preference for keeping current policy unchanged but Opec-plus meetings are known for delivering surprises. Europeâ€™s benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures edged higher as uncertain arbitrage economics threatened to cut off lifeblood diesel imports, which can now only come from outside of Russia. Prompt supply fears have twisted the forward price curve back into backwardation despite ongoing concerns about the strength of Europe's economy and its appetite for fuel. Front-month June LSGO futures had leapt to a $8.50 per metric ton premium over the six-month November screen by Thursday, up from parity a week ago. Prompt ultra-low-sulfur diesel cargo premiums also ticked higher from $12/ton to $13.25/ton over the screen. Four months on from the EU's ban on Russian fuel imports, alternative and much longer haul diesel supplies from refiners East of Suez are beginning to dry up. European jet cargo premiums fell from $40.75/ton to $37.25/ton over front-month LSGO futures as disappointing airline buying started to take a toll. Regional departures were 8% below pre-pandemic levels in the week to May 31, according to Eurocontrol, with fuel uplift currently pegged at least 12% below 2019 volumes. Traders see limited prospects for European aviation's Covid-19 recovery this summer. No jet cargoes have changed hands in Europeâ€™s end-of-day pricing window for almost a month now with the last trade reported on May 4. Lower imports have hit market liquidity with arrivals down 28% in May versus April at just under 1.4 million tons, according to Kpler data. Current tanker tracking suggests another sharp drop this month with just 1 million tons expected so far in June. Jet tanks fell to a 10-week low of 841,000 tons on Jun. 1, according to Insights Global after no tankers arrived but volume left for the UK and Norway. Brokers say most import tankers are heading to France and the UK. US jet fuel markets sprang back to life over the Memorial Day holiday that kicks off the unofficial start to summer travel. Deliveries surged by 25% to nearly 1.8 million b/d in the week ended May 26, according to government data. Through the month of April jet demand languished at 1.58 million b/d â€ just 2.3% above the year-earlier rate when air travel was still restricted by Covid-19 precautions. US oil prices slipped another 50Â? in after-hours trading on the news that the US House of Representatives was on track to approve a deal to increase the nation's debt ceiling after a bipartisan vote to take up the bill passed by a 241-187 margin. Both the gasoline and diesel contracts expired on Wednesday. Gasoline closed at $2.56 per gallon, nearly unchanged on the month, while diesel settled at $2.26 having lost 12Â? since the beginning of May. Asian jet markets continued their retreat as benchmark Singapore spot price differentials sank to their lowest level in nine and a half months. The market softened even though large volumes of arbitrage headed west toward the Suez Canal. The Singapore price differential sank by 10Â?/bbl from a week ago to a 2Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Jun. 1 â€ its lowest level since mid-August last year. Major volumes of arbitrage jet are leaving Asia and the Mideast in late May and June. A total of 1.12 million bbl of arbitrage jet loaded from May 28-30 from South Korea, according to Kpler. The supplies are heading to the US, Africa and Europe and expected to arrive between mid-June and mid-July. Another 503,000 bbl of arbitrage jet loaded on May 30 from Kuwait en route towards Europe, with an arrival date of Jul. 27. About 4.3 million bbl are loading in June from Korea and India, according to Kpler. The volumes are pointed at the US and Europe with arrival dates ranging from Jun. 23 to Jul. 21. Another 2.5 million bbl are loading from Jun. 2-9 from ports in the UAE, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and headed towards Europe. Page 2 of 3 Prices Lose Altitude Ahead of Opec Meeting        "
"2023_6";"Saudi Cut Fails to Move Markets.txt";" Saudi Arabia's surprise 1 million barrel per day July production cut barely moved oil markets, which are still more concerned with the state of global buying. â€?Market players are not buying into the [looming oil supply] deficit story, nor are they convinced by Chinaâ€™s revival,"" concluded PVM Oil analyst Stephen Brennock. Rumors of a new US-Iran nuclear deal, which could unleash more Iranian oil onto the market, hit prices late in the week before Washington denied the claims. International benchmark Brent finished the week $1.68 per barrel higher at $75.96/bbl at Thursdayâ€™s close, while US marker West Texas Intermediate finished $1.19/bbl higher at $71.29/bbl.  Itâ€™s a far cry from the $5/bbl gains seen after the last Opec-plus agreement in April. That deal to take 1.657 million b/d off the market from May to the end of this year kept Brent above $80/bbl for more than three weeks. Saudi Arabiaâ€™s voluntary cut only applies to July but comes in addition to the kingdomâ€™s rolling 500,000 b/d cut announced in April. It could be extended depending on price developments. Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman described the additional commitment as a ""lollipop."" It was framed as a precautionary measure given uncertainty over how quickly global oil demand might recover in the remainder of this year. Europeâ€™s jet fuel cargo trading window sprang back to life with a bumper six deals struck this week. Swiss trader Glencore sold four cargo lots or 120,000 tons to regional major BP into Rotterdam, Amsterdam, the UKâ€™s Isle of Grain and Le Havre. BP also bought 30,000 tons from Chinaâ€™s Unipec, which has the LR2 Front Leopard bringing jet from both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain into Le Havre. Unipec sold another 30,000 ton lot from the same ship into Le Havre to French oil company TotalEnergies. Most deals were Platts-related except for Glencore to BP into Le Havre Jun. 18-22, which was struck at a $50 per ton premium to second-month July ICE low sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures on Jun. 8. This week's trading followed almost a month-long drought in deals. Northwest European jet cargo premiums were pegged at a $35/ton premium to front-month June ICE LSGO futures at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from $37.25/ton a week ago. LSGO prices rose faster than crude, with backwardation widening as traders grow increasingly nervous about sourcing non-Russian diesel. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) fell for a third week in a row to 824,000 tons on Jun. 8, according to Insights Global. Import tankers are increasingly heading to the French port of Le Havre over ARA as the market works to balance earlier French refinery and port worker strikes. No jet imports arrived in Rotterdam last month, according to Kpler, when 390,000 tons discharged into Le Havre. Airline fuel demand continues to recover as more long-haul routes are added. Network manager Eurocontrol this week flagged air traffic above pre-pandemic levels on routes from Europe to both North America and the Middle East. Overall traffic is still only 94% of 2019 levels. Jet fuel markets waded through another choppy week as oil prices got caught up in cross-currents. The smoky haze that engulfed the East Coast this week is impacting jet fuel demand, which already took a steep 16% tumble in the week ending Jun. 2. Sales dropped below 1.5 million b/d from more than 1.78 in the prior Memorial Day holiday week. More flight cancellations are expected as the smoke drifts into the Southeast and Midwest, FAA officials warned. There is more stormy weather to come. Researchers in North Carolina have predicted a more active than usual Atlantic hurricane season this year, with some seven to nine hurricanes forming. The US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration, meanwhile, forecasts a 30% chance of higher than usual storm activity, estimating that some 12-17 storms will be strong enough to be named. The impact of unsettled weather on flight operations is getting more severe. Earlier this year, pilots navigated through an atmospheric river that developed over the West Coast, where massive forest fires have also affected flight paths. Asian jet markets strengthened slightly even as variable air traffic trends pulled prompt jet demand in different directions. Singapore spot price differentials rose by 8Â?/bbl to a 10Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Jun. 8. The gain lifted prices off their lowest level in 9Â? months. But differentials are still languishing at the low end of seasonal price trends. Scheduled airline capacity for the week of Jun. 5 sank by 1.2% in Northeast Asia, according to OAG. But airline capacity rose by 1.6% over the same period in the Mideast. Page 2 of 3 Saudi Cut Fails to Move Markets        "
"2023_7";"Bulls Take the Lead as Brent Pushes Past $80.txt";"  Sentiment is turning in favor of higher oil prices with international benchmark Brent consistently at the top of its recent $71-$81 per barrel trading range. Russia will cut production by 500,000 barrels per day next month, when Saudi Arabia will also extend its current 1 million b/d cut for another month. Russian loadings are already running at their lowest level in six-months. OECD inventories are starting to fall in response to Opec-plus supply restraints just as demand starts to pick up.  Beijing is looking at various fiscal stimuli to kick-start Chinaâ€™s economy after Covid-19. Falling inflation in the US and Europe could also signal an end to demand damaging interest rate hikes. Brent nevertheless finished the week down $1.72/bbl at $79.64/bbl while US domestic price pin WTI shed $1.74/bbl to close at $75.65/bbl. Firmer airline buying and higher imports sparked a flurry of jet fuel cargo deals in Europe. Regional air traffic is within 7% of pre-pandemic levels, according to Eurocontrol, slightly below the network managerâ€™s expectation of a 5% deficit this summer. The week saw a bumper six cargo deals: Swiss trader Glencore bought three separate 30,000-metric ton parcels from Chinaâ€™s Unipec into Rotterdam. Into-wing heavyweight Shell bought from three different sellers: from Vitol for Le Havre, BP for Shell Haven and Unipec for Rotterdam. Thursdayâ€™s window saw Shell paying a $58 per ton premium to August ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures for fuel onboard the LR2 Proteus Ingrid coming from Malaysia and due into Rotterdam Jul. 31-Aug.4. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) fell to a four-month low of just 711,000 tons on Jul. 20, according to Insights Global, 11% below where they were this time last year. Most import tankers are avoiding ARA and heading straight to jet demand centers in France and the UK. The stock monitor flagged just one cargo arriving in ARA from South Korea this week. Low Rhine river levels are still hampering inland barge flows. Europe is on track to import 2.12 million metric tons of jet from East of Suez this month, up from 1.5 million tons in June and the second highest on record. Kpler data show an all-time high 773,000 tons coming to Europe from Kuwait followed by 565,000 tons from India, 220,000 tons from the United Arab Emirates, 178,000 tons from Saudi Arabia and 164,000 tons each from both South Korea and Bahrain. Kuwait is still struggling to make the ultra-low-sulfur diesel Europe so keenly needs with state Kuwait Petroleum Corp.â€™s new Al Zour refinery swelling jet fuel sales instead. Al Zourâ€™s third crude distillation unit came online this week with the refinery set to reach its full 615,000 b/d capacity by September. US jet fuel demand should be approaching its annual peak during the summer travel season. But up-gauging by airlines â€ operating fewer flights by putting more passengers on larger planes â€ has cut into fuel usage. Jet liftings averaged 1.68 million b/d over the last month â€ versus 1.8 million b/d in the same period of 2019. Flight disruptions from severe weather and shortages in air traffic controllers have also put a lid on demand, with major airlines cutting flights out of New York-area airports by 10% this summer to help avoid delays and cancellations. United nonetheless cancelled nearly 20% of its flights in the week heading into the July 4th weekend, disrupting services across its entire network. Seasonal patterns are also padding refining margins across the downstream sector. Strong returns have encouraged refiners to boost throughput all summer, which reached 94.3% in the week ended Jul. 14. They churned out 1.78 million b/d of jet fuel, widening the market surplus and adding 600,00 barrels to stock levels. The East Coast accounted for most of the stockbuild as plentiful imports flowed into regional ports. By mid-July East Coast tanks were 32% higher than the year-ago mark. Asian jet markets continued to strengthen as benchmark Singapore spot price differentials climbed to their highest level in more than two months. Significant arbitrage jet volumes heading westwards helped buoy market sentiment. Singapore spot differentials rose by 20Â?/bbl to a 30Â?/bbl premium over Singapore quotes on Jul. 20, its highest level since May 16. A total of 3.95 million bbl of arbitrage jet are loading from Jul. 20-30 from South Korea, India and China, according to Kpler. The volumes are pointed at Europe, the US and the Americas, with expected arrival dates in second-half August. Another 2.5 million bbl of arbitrage jet loaded from Jul. 18-26 from Kuwait, Bahrain and the UAE, based on Kpler data. These volumes are pointed at Europe and Africa and due to arrive in the Aug. 8-22 timeframe. Falling air traffic in three of the four major regional aviation markets East of Suez was largely offset by a 1% gain in the largest Northeast Asian market, according to OAG.

"2023_7";"Headwinds For South Korean Refined Fuel Exports.txt";" Highlight: Long-term fuel demand growth is expected to taper off over the course of our 10-year forecast in-line with planned diversification away from fossil fuels. South Korea's refined fuels consumption is set for a structural decline over the forecast period, due to a combination of the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) decarbonisation initiatives. South Korea consumes about 2.65mn bbl of fuels daily, but the market is facing structural decline, as fuel efficiency gains and energy conservation efforts see demand growth gradually contracting over the coming years.      Key View • Long-term fuel demand growth is expected to taper off over the course of our 10-year forecast in-line with planned diversification away from fossil fuels. • Recent demand data for transport fuels shows slower growth rates despite the government's generous consumption tax cuts. • Transport fuel demand faces further significant downward pressures from the rapid penetration of EVs, which now represent a growing share of the transport fleet. • The slowdown in the domestic fuel market could push refiners to focus more on the export of surplus fuels to international markets. Long-term fuel demand growth is expected to taper off over the course of our 10-year forecast in-line with planned diversification away from fossil fuels. South Korea's refined fuels consumption is set for a structural decline over the forecast period, due to a combination of the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) decarbonisation initiatives. South Korea consumes about 2.65mn bbl of fuels daily, but the market is facing structural decline, as fuel efficiency gains and energy conservation efforts see demand growth gradually contracting over the coming years. The decarbonisation target for fuel switching in the road transport sector is ambitious and will bring about major reductions in fuel consumption. The national objective is to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, which will require emissions reduction measures to be introduced in most fuel-intensive sectors. We forecast South Korea's fuel consumption will decrease by 1.6% annually between 2023 and 2032, with total volumes tapering off to 2.3mn b/d in 2032. Recent demand data for transport fuels displayed slower growth rates despite the government's generous consumption tax cuts. South Korea runs one of the most liberalised fuel markets in Asia, but the government pursued policies offering indirect subsidies in the form of tax cuts on transport fuels to keep consumers insulated from inflationary pressures from rising energy prices. Since November 2021, the government introduced consumption tax cuts on gasoline and diesel in an effort to stimulate demand growth and ease the burden from rising fuel costs at the pumps. In April 2023, the government decided to extend consumption tax cuts of 25% on gasoline and 37% on diesel until the end of August 2023. However, the measures appeared to have limited impact on transport fuel consumption, with gasoline and diesel demand growth showing only modest growth. Monthly data suggests demand for gasoline and diesel fuels in the transport industry rose marginally in the second and third quarters of 2022. However, such short-lived demand growth appeared to be bolstered by consumers' rush to hoard fuels before the government ends tax cuts, rather than actual consumption. We can expect temporary increase in transport fuel consumption in Q3 2023, however demand for transport fuels could slip back again if the government chooses not to extend tax cuts beyond August 2023. Demand for diesel from industrial and heavy-duty transport vehicles is more likely to be adversely affected if the government discontinues tax cuts. Transport fuel demand faces further significant downward pressures from the rapid penetration of EVs, which now represent a growing share of the transport fleet. Our autos team maintain the view that South Korean EV sales will continue to grow as the government further incentivises such purchases by offering scrappage incentives, extending EV subsidies, implementing a carbon tax and potentially limiting the use of internal combustion-engine vehicles (ICEs). The government's plan to support the early scrapping of older vehicles to reduce the number of ICE vehicles in their fleet could place further downward pressures on demand for transport fuels. The Ministry of Environment plans to include Grade 4 and Grade 5 diesel vehicles and construction machinery in the targets for early scrapping. This will generate downside risks to diesel consumption, offering a boost to commercial EV sales. South Korea's newly finalised decarbonisation roadmap for the transportation sector calls for 85-97% of the car fleet to be hydrogen-powered or battery-operated EVs with the remainder running on lower-sulphur fuels. Our auto team projects the share of EVs as a percentage of total vehicle fleet is expected to rise from 1.9% in 2022 up to 13.9% in 2032. The slowdown in the domestic fuel market could push refiners to focus more on the export of surplus fuels to international markets. Refiners will continue to focus maximising diesel, gasoline and jet fuel exports to regional markets as part of their long-term business strategies. The attention will be focused on maintaining higher levels of diesel exports since refineries are configured to maximise diesel output. Diesel and gasoline are expected to remain a key component of fuel exports, with the bulk of exports heading to Australia, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. Exports to Singapore and Malaysia could face headwinds from rising production and exports out of Malaysia and Brunei, who can ship diesel cargoes to Singapore at much lower shipping costs, threatening South Korea's traditional market shares. However, refineries could switch to maximising jet fuel production instead of diesel to maintain higher level of exports over the long run due its established jet fuel import markets in east and west of Suez. South Korean refiners traditionally run at higher utilisation rates allowing them to maintain higher level of fuel exports. We anticipate South Korea's average refinery utilisation rates to remain high in 2023 supported by the government's announcement in July 2023 to abolish import tariffs on crude oil. Such measures could encourage refiners to ramp up production and allow them to lower refinery gate prices, easing upward inflationary pressures retail prices. However, as a mature economy and slowdown in demand for refined fuels, those with lower domestic market shares and export market outlets could become more sensitive to their runs. Currently, refinery closures in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines are providing window of opportunities for refiners to boost refinery runs and exports. But, this may change in future due to rising competition from export-oriented refineries in Asia and Middle East and sluggish demand. Our analysis shows gasoline and diesel exports as a percentage of refinery production has been declining in recent months due to a combination of growing supplies in Asia and weakening crack spreads. South Korea's refiners and expected to face headwinds in the long term stemming from rising competition from regional refineries in the midst of maturing domestic market and lack of growth in transport fuel exports constraining their ability to ramp up utilisation rates.

"2023_7";"Charting the global economy.txt";"   Underlying inflation cooled in the U.S. and quickened in Europe, according to the latest readings, while central bankers in both regions signalled they're prepared to raise interest rates further.   In China, where the economy was expected to stage a huge rebound this year, the problems just keep piling up. On top of weak consumer spending and a housing slump, holiday tourism moderated last month and industrial profits are still plunging.   Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy.   U.S. and Canada   U.S. consumer spending  has lost steam for most of this year, portending weaker growth ahead while also helping to cool inflation. That weakness contrasts with recent data that have otherwise painted a picture of a resilient economy rather than one on the brink of recession.   Canadian inflation slowed to its weakest pace in two years and core measures edged lower, reducing - but not removing - pressure on the central bank for another interest-rate hike this month. Policymakers could be forced to raise rates again for the second straight month in July if gross domestic product and jobs figures still point to an overheated economy.   Europe   Euro-area core inflation accelerated in June to an annual gain of 5.4 per cent from 5.3 per cent in the prior month as the cost of services picked up markedly. With inflation initially driven by shocks including the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, concerns now centre around strong demand for services such as travel, and accelerating wage gains to make up for lost income.    Germany's business outlook deteriorated to the lowest seen this year, evidence that Europe's biggest economy is struggling to cement a recovery after a recent recession.   China   It was meant to be the year China's economy, unshackled from the world's strictest COVID-19 controls, roared back to help power global growth. Instead, halfway through 2023, it's facing a confluence of problems: Sluggish consumer spending, a crisis-ridden property market, flagging exports, record youth unemployment and towering local government debt.   China's consumer-driven recovery is showing more signs of losing momentum as spending slows on everything from holiday travel to cars and homes, adding to expectations for more stimulus to support the economy. Domestic travel spending during the recent holiday for the dragon-boat festival was lower than pre-pandemic levels.   Profits at industrial firms in China kept dropping in May, reflecting the impact of soft demand and ongoing factory-gate deflation. Falling profits will likely continue to weigh on business sentiment, which was already in decline.   Emerging markets   Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate raced to triple digits for the first time in five months after multiple devaluations of the local currency led prices to surge. The new gauge was selected as the agency said it better reflects the nation's economic reality because it tracks prices in both U.S. and Zimbabwean dollars, unlike the previous benchmark that only assessed costs in local-currency terms.   Pakistan clinched an initial approval from the International Monetary Fund for a $3-billion (U.S.) loan program, lowering the risk of a sovereign default. The IMF loans are crucial in helping the South Asian nation manage $23 billion of external debt payments for the fiscal year starting July, more than six times its foreign-exchange reserves.

"2023_7";"Chinese Buying Fuels Oil Price Gains.txt";" Brent topped $81 per barrel for the first time in almost three months on surging Chinese crude imports. Official data show imports hitting 12.72 million barrels per day in June â€ the second highest on record, according to Energy Intelligence data going back to 2007, and a multiyear high. Imports were up 560,000 b/d on already strong May volumes and 3.97 million b/d higher than June last year when China still had widespread Covid-19 countermeasures in place. China's aviation recovery still has some way to go with a strong domestic air market held back by a lack of international flights.  Bullish traders chose to ignore the downward revisions to oil demand made by the International Energy Agency in its latest Oil Market Report, published Thursday. Opecâ€™s latest market missive points to firmer consumption this year, which is suddenly more in line with market sentiment. The US Energy Information Administration is also predicting sharp stock draws well into next year as oil demand outpaces supply amid ongoing Opec-plus production cuts. International benchmark Brent finished $4.84/bbl higher at $81.36/bbl, while US price-pin WTI gained $5.09/bbl to close at $76.89/bbl. ICE low sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures also posted big gains with fears about Europeâ€™s ability to compete with buoyant Asian markets adding to middle-distillate market anxiety. Backwardation came in sharply with forward months gaining even more ground. Europe badly needs Mideast and Asian diesel, as well as US fuel, in the long term to make up for missing Russian barrels, which now head mainly to Turkey, North Africa and Brazil. Jet cargo differentials also ticked higher, reaching a $58.75 per metric ton premium to the new August LSGO contract by Thursday's close with flat prices up almost 6% on the week. Into-wing heavyweight Shell bought twice in the window: 30,000 tons from TotalEnergies into Le Havre Jul. 31-Aug. 4 on Tuesday and the same volume from Vitol into the UKâ€™s Shell Haven Jul. 22-26 the following day. Both deals were done against Plattsâ€™ pricing. Europe is continuing to attract healthy East of Suez jet imports, although most tankers are avoiding Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) where low river levels have severely hampered inland barge movements. Jet tanks in ARA fell for a fourth week in a row, according to local monitor Insights Global. At 730,000 tons on Jul. 13, tanks are their lowest in nearly four months and 10% below where they were at this time last year. No import tankers arrived in ARA, with recent arrivals mostly heading to the UK and France, while volumes left for Senegal and the fuel-hungry UK. Europeâ€™s air traffic is now within 7% of pre-pandemic levels, according to Europeâ€™s network manager Eurocontrol, including more long-haul flights to Asia. Airlines are still warning of flight cancellations this summer, blaming constrained airspace due to the war in Ukraine for air traffic control delays. Strike action at airports is also set to impact flights from London's Gatwick airport later this month. US jet fuel markets are showing signs of loosening, with inventory levels edging higher as airline demand sags following the busy Fourth of July holiday. The latest government data show total US commercial jet stocks rising 400,000 bbl to 41.8 million bbl the week ending Jul. 7. That is 500,000 bbl higher than this time last year. Jet consumption took a 153,000 b/d step down in the week after the holidays. But at 1.5 million b/d, airline buying is still 174,000 b/d stronger than last year. Over the last four weeks US jet demand is still averaging more than 1.7 million b/d, up 10.5% over the same period of 2022. Cooling US inflation suggests some of the macroeconomic headwinds affecting oil demand could be starting to dissipate. Fears of further interest rates hikes and a looming US economic recession have eased. But supply issues remain. Jet fuel cracks continue to lag those for both diesel and gasoline. Europe's thirst for diesel means higher refinery output won't necessarily translate into more jet as refiners shift yields towards diesel. Overseas demand for US jet is still riding high. Jet exports surged to 204,000 b/d last week, taking the four-week average to almost 170,000 b/d. That is well above the volumes seen last year, although exports remain below pre-pandemic levels. Imports have been swinging widely. The most recent week saw them fall to their lowest level since early January at just 34,000 b/d. Asia's jet market ticked higher on further gains in air traffic. The benchmark Singapore spot price differential rose by 4Â?/bbl on the week to a 10Â?/bbl premium over to Singapore quotes by Thursday's close. Prompt regional jet demand was boosted by rising air traffic with gains across Asia's three regional markets offsetting a slight drop in flight numbers in the Middle East. China is still holding the region back. Chinese international airline capacity has grown four-fold since January to 4.4 million seats in July, but remains barely half of pre-pandemic levels and accounts for only 5.6% of total Chinese capacity, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. In contrast, international flights made up 12.1% of total Chinese capacity in July 2019. â€?For both Japan and South Korea, any further recovery remains dependent on the rebuilding of connectivity to China and ... that has a very long way to go, so we shouldnâ€™t expect any significant change in their respective recoveries for some time,â€ OAG warned.

"2023_7";"IMF _ Global Economy on Track.txt";"  The global economy is headed in the right direction with stronger growth and lower inflation, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a new report published on Tuesday. But, also, the IMF warned that inflation could rise if the war in Ukraine intensified, citing concern about Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative, or if more extreme temperature increases caused by the El Nino weather pattern pushed up commodity prices. In the latest update to its World Economic Outlook, the agency said it expects global growth of 3% in both 2023 and 2024. The IMF bumped up its 2023 projections by 0.2 percentage points from its previous estimate three months ago and kept the 2024 outlook unchanged. Also, it said the rise in central bank policy rates to fight inflation continues to weigh on economic activity, forecasting that global headline inflation would fall to 6.8% in 2023 from 8.7% in 2022, dropping to 5.2% in 2024. The IMF noted that key to inflation's persistence will be labor market developments and wage-profit dynamics. Also, the 2023-2024 growth forecast remains weak by historical standards, well below the annual average of 3.8% seen in 2000-2019, largely due to weaker manufacturing in advanced economies, and it could stay at that level for years. Inflation: No. 1 Enemy The IMF raised its 2023 global growth prediction by 0.2 percentage points to 3%, up from 2.8% at its April assessment. By July, the economic outlook has grown a little brighter: The Covid pandemic is no longer considered a global health crisis, supply chains are flowing more smoothly and economic activity has remained steady amid strong labor markets, the IMF said. The resolution of the debt ceiling standoff and swift action by regulators to quell banking crises in the United States and Europe helped stem the risks of a broader financial crisis, the IMF said Tuesday, cautioning that ""the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside."" When looking across the global economy, there are concerns that China's recovery could slow further, as its debt-laden real estate sector weighs on growth, according to the report. And there's also concern that ""geoeconomics fragmentation: - where geopolitical ideals could shift economic powers away from globalization and toward a more nationalistic and fractured approach - could disrupt trade, the cross-border movements of money and people and commodity prices. Key to inflation's persistence will be labor market developments and wage-profit dynamics, the IMF said. Still, priority No. 1 is for economies to conquer inflation, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, said in a statement. Flexibility and Risks IMF experts said economic activity in the first quarter of the year proved resilient, but that many challenges still cloud the horizon. ""Global economic activity has proven resilient in the first quarter of this year, leading to a modest upward revision for global growth in 2023,"" Gourinchas said. ""But global growth remains weak by historical standards."" He added: ""Urgent action is needed to strengthen global cooperation on climate policies, international trade, or debt restructuring, to address common challenges."" ""Inflation could remain high or increase, for instance from an intensification of Russia's war in Ukraine or extreme weather-related events,"" Gourinchas said. ""This could require a further tightening of monetary policy and lead to another bout of financial market volatility."" ""We need monetary policy to remain restrictive until there are clear signs that underlying inflation is cooling,"" he said. The IMF said Saudi Arabia achieved a 1.9% GPD growth in 2023. It forecasted a 2.8% in 2024. Meanwhile, overall growth in the Middle East and Central Asia region is projected to decline to 2.5% in 2023, from 5.4% last year, the IMF said. Poor Growth in Emerging Markets The IMF projected that a large share of growth in 2023 will come from emerging markets and developing economies, with ""broadly stable"" growth of 4 to 4.1% in 2023 and 2024 respectively. It raised its outlook for the United States, the world's largest economy, forecasting growth of 1.8% in 2023 versus 1.6% in April as labor markets remained strong. Euro zone countries are expected to grow 0.9% in 2023 and 1.5% in 2024, both up 0.1% from April. Japan's growth was also revised upward by 1.4% in 2023, but the IMF left its outlook for 2024 unchanged at 1.0%.  Page 2 of 3 IMF : Global Economy on Track        "
"2023_7";"IMF sees signs global economy is headed in the right direction.txt";" Could the global economy be witnessing the final stage of the inflationary cycle that started in 2021? Recent data have sparked hope of a ""touchdown"" of inflation, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, in a new update to its World Economic Outlook released Tuesday. ""Stronger growth and lower inflation than expected are welcome news, suggesting the global economy is headed in the right direction,"" said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, in a blog accompanying the report. As is often the case, there are more risks that the economy will stumble and disappoint, rather than surprise to the upside. ""Challenges still cloud the horizon, and it is too soon to celebrate,"" Gourinchas said. The IMF only tweaked its formal outlook. Under the baseline forecast, the IMF forecasts the global economy will slow from last year's 3.5% rate to 3% rate this year and next. Growth this year was revised up by 0.2 percentage points. The euro zone and the United Kingdom are relatively weak among the advanced economies. Global inflation is projected to decline from a 8.7% rate last year to 6.8% rate this year, 0.2 percentage points lower than expected, and continue down to a 5.2% rate in 2024. What are the risks? Signs are growing that global activity is losing momentum, as the rapid increase in interest rates is starting to bite. In the U.S., excess savings ""are all but depleted,"" the IMF said. In China, the economy is showing signs of losing steam amid continued concerns about the property sector. And core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is looking stubborn in the most developed economy. It is expected to remain unchanged at 5.1% in 2023 from last year. It will start to move lower next year, to a 3.1% rate, the IMF said. ""Clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won,"" Gourinchas said. The key to the persistence of inflation will be labor market developments and wage-profit dynamics, the IMF said. ""Greedflation"" isn't the villan, Gourinchas said. Wage inflation has lagged behind price inflation in most places because ""prices adjust upward faster than wages"" when demand exceeds what the economy can produce. In an optimistic note, Gourinchas said there was room for higher wages without triggering higher prices, known as a wage-price spiral.

"2023_7";"OPEC _ Oil and the Global Economy.txt";"Highlight: OPEC released its monthly report for June early Thursday morning.  OPEC released its monthly report for June early this morning, reiterating its 2023 world oil demand growth forecast for 2.3 million barrels per day. The group's expectation for China, Latin America, and the Middle East have been revised up slightly, while OECD Europe, Other Asia and Africa have been adjusted slightly lower. OPEC sees the global economy growing at 2.6% this year, down from 3.3% in 2022, with the US economy now expected to grow at 1.3% this year, up 0.1%. China's economic  remains at 5.2% for 2023, following a growth of 3.0% for 2022. India's 2022 economic growth estimate is unchanged at 6.7%, and the forecast for 2023 remains at 5.6%. The Eurozone's economic growth forecast for 2023 remains at 0.8%, following a growth of 3.5% for 2022. While it could be argued that OPEC is biased when formulating its guidance for oil demand, signs the US economy is poised for a softer than previously expected landing and prospects for further stimulus in China could fuel greater demand for oil than previously expected. We'll look for that confirmation, keeping in mind extended production cuts by Saudi Arabia that could lead to some tightening in the oil market.

"2023_7";"Pacific Snapshot_ Air Travel Spike Depletes Jet Stocks.txt";" Reopening of borders for air travel lifted the region's jet demand and drove regional stocks down by 22% versus year-earlier rates. Lean tanks put the region in a vulnerable position heading into the spring travel season. The air travel spike in Japan drove stocks down by 20% from February to 3.9 million bbl â€ a 14% deficit versus last year when demand was much lower. Japanese jet fuel demand recovered to 201,000 b/d in March, nearly 40% higher than year-earlier levels when air travel restrictions were still in effect. Refiners lifted output to 184,000 b/d to meet the surge, and jet yields reached 6.5%. Another 10,000 b/d of bonded fuel was imported to supply international flights. Japanese refiners also exported 38,000 b/d, mainly to the US West Coast where demand was taking off.  Page 2 of 2 Pacific Snapshot: Air Travel Spike Depletes Jet Stocks        "
"2023_7";"Spot Cargo Markets_ Mounting Risks of Faltering Chinese Demand.txt";"  Brent traded consistently above $80 per barrel this week, reflecting a tighter oil market after Saudi Arabia cut July supply by 1 million barrels per day. But the risk of a Chinese demand downgrade still lingers and has soured the marketâ€™s buoyant mood â€ keeping prices in a tight trading range. Chinese jet fuel demand is expected to make up about 250,000 b/d of a projected 2 million b/d gain in global demand in 2023. One third of that is still to be recovered, but international flights into and out of the country are still 55% below 2019 levels. Market bulls are struggling to impart some fresh price momentum, partly because the slowing pace of inventory draws is casting doubts about the actual strength of demand. Jet fuel stocks in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) storage hub climbed to 721,000 tons on Jul.  27, ending a multi-week streak of inventory draws, Insights Global data showed. Jet stockpiles bottomed out to 711,000 tons the prior week, their lowest since Mar. 23 and about 11% beneath their year-ago levels. Meanwhile diesel and gasoil stocks continued to creep up for the second straight week, reaching 2 million tons or nearly 40% above their year-ago mark. International benchmark Brent climbed $3.17/bbl and settled at $84.24/bbl. The front-month Nymex West Texas Intermediate September contract closed at $80.09/bbl, gaining $3.02/bbl on the week. Regional refining constraints have tightened European supplies of mid-distillates. European refiners are dealing with lower availability of heavier, sour crude in the Atlantic Basin, which caps their yields of gasoil and jet fuel. ICE low sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures reflect that more bullish factor, with the forward curve firming up again after prompt prices broke through $800 per metric ton. The front-month August 2023 contract was trading at $854.25/ton mid-session on Friday. But the regrade or jet fuel premium over ultra-low-sulfur diesel narrowed to $41.50/ton at Thursday's close, down from $45.75/ton a week ago. This points to a slightly looser prompt market which the ARA stockbuild confirms. Arbitrage cargoes are still making their way to Europe from the Middle East, with around 517,000 b/d of jet shipping from East of Suez in July. But higher jet prices in Asia are increasingly attracting spot jet cargoes looking for more lucrative markets. Jet cargo differentials softened on the week, ticking down to a $55.25 per metric ton premium to the August LSGO contract by Thursday's close, or 5% lower than last week. Independent trading house Glencore bought twice from Unipec, the trading arm of Chinaâ€™s state-owned giant Sinopec: 27,000 tons into Rotterdam Aug 9-13 on Friday, and the same volume into Rotterdam Aug 15-19 on Thursday. The first deal was done against the August ICE LSGO contract, the second against Plattsâ€™ CIF cargo mean (CCM). On Wednesday BP sold a cargo to Shell: 27,000 tons into Shell Haven Aug. 8-12 priced against Plattsâ€™ CCM. Meanwhile European air traffic was mostly unchanged at around 92% of its 2019 levels. Europe is still a hive of strike action that affects the aviation sector, extending from airline staff to air traffic controllers. Several walkouts are planned all over the region this summer, adding to the wildfire disruptions in southern Europe. US Mid-Distillate Spike US jet fuel markets shot higher in tandem with the spike in low-sulfur diesel futures, which jumped by 18Â? per gallon on the week. The prompt contract closed at $2.91/gallon on Thursday as mid-distillates compete with gasoline in the downstream refining slate. US refineries are running at peak throughput, with utilization rates rising to 93.4% in the week ended Jul. 21. They churned out 1.7 million b/d of jet fuel. A 15% spike versus the prior week boosted jet demand above 1.8 million b/d. Imports jumped by 50% to 120,000 b/d as more cargoes flowed into the East Coast to replenish inventories and offset a dearth of supplies via the Colonial pipeline. A 1.1 million barrel drop in stocks to 41.3 million bbl signaled the tighter market. Tanks are 2.8% higher than year-ago levels, when demand was about 2% lower. Valero's second quarter results reflect how the US refining boom is running its course, even as renewable fuels bolster earnings. Its refineries posted throughput of 3 million b/d in the second quarter of 2023, with operating income of $2.4 billion, down from $6.2 billion in the same three months a year earlier. The company's biofuels activities generated a combined $567 million in operating income in the April-June period, of which $440 million came from its renewable diesel joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel, with the other $127 million coming from its ethanol operations. The pull from Europe caused Asian jet markets to lurch higher, with benchmark Singapore spot price differentials jumping to their highest level in more than two and a half months. Significant arbitrage jet volumes pointing westward bolstered the market. Singapore spot differentials jumped by 41Â?/bbl to a 71Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Jul. 27, the highest level since May 9. A total of 1.86 million bbl of arbitrage jet loaded from Jul. 26-30 from South Korea, China and India, according to Kpler. The volumes are pointed at the US and Europe, with expected arrival dates ranging from Aug. 11 to Sep. 19. Another 2.8 million of arbitrage jet loaded from Jul. 28-30 from Kuwait, Qatar and the Mideast, with these volumes heading toward Europe and expected to arrive from Aug. 24 to Sep. 2. A total of 1.7 million bbl of arbitrage jet are so far scheduled to load from Aug. 4-21 from South Korea and India, according to Kpler. These cargoes are expected to head to the US and Europe. Rising air traffic in two of the largest regional aviation markets East of Suez lifted prompt jet demand and offset a decline in the Mideast, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. Airline capacity held steady in the largest Northeast Asian market. Page 2 of 3 Spot Cargo Markets: Mounting Risks of Faltering Chinese Demand        "

"2023_8";"Europe jet fuel price rally stalls following upstream volatility, fading gasoil strength.txt";"Consumption for aviation and road fuels has started to soften as the wind-down of the summer travel season begins, with lower gasoil and jet fuel spending exerting downward pressure on prices.  • End of peak travel season tapers demand  • Pricing expected to fall in coming months  • Jet kerosene pricing largely range-bound for now   Greater volatility observed in Brent crude values and softening gasoil demand has dented the upward rally observed in the European jet fuel prices since end of May ahead of the summer months.   Trading has been close to nil on the cargoes side in the last couple of weeks, while barges have seen only a handful of tonnages traded in the open market towards mid-August before substantiating dwindling demand.   As such, jet differentials to ICE gasoil futures for cargoes have plunged by 7% week-on-week while barges by as much as 17% in the week to Wednesday 23 August, when compared to same time last week.   Despite the drop in differentials, European jet kerosene spot prices stayed fairly rangebound, with weekly averages dropping by 1-2% from Q3 peaks recorded towards early August largely on the back of upstream strength.   The prompt-month crack spread against rolling Brent has remained firm at $38.5/bbl with the market in contango.   That said, market structure appears to be seeing a shift, with gasoil strength cooling slightly.   The impact of tightness recorded in the gasoil market during summer months, owing to reduced imports and high temperatures causing local refinery issues, incentivised some producers to benefit from better margins on gasoil and diesel, albeit buying interest appears to be dwindling.   This has been further exacerbated by backwardation in the market, which has seen little buying for restocking purposes. A backwardation typically discourages storage economics.   While jet fuel market activity has been fairly quiet this week, greater volatility in upstream crude and ICE gasoil futures have caused market unrest, pressurising outright values amid lowering buying interest.   The sustained rally seen in benchmark  prices since the end of June is running out of steam as bearish China economic indicators, the rising value of the US dollar and concerns that the US Federal Reserve has not finished its programme of interest rate hikes pushed oil prices under pressure following seven weeks of gains.   The ICE gasoil futures market has been in steep backwardation with the front-month to second-month price spread widening to -$12.75/tonne on Wednesday at close of business.   Meanwhile, stocks in the major Antwerp-Rotterdam-Amsterdam (ARA) hub have been dropping since mid-July up until early August, although have seen only a marginal decline in two weeks to 17 August. That said, current inventory levels are 16% from same time last year.   Low inventory data substantiates market tightness, thus capping major losses in outright values.

"2023_8";"European Snapshot_ Higher Air Traffic Swells Jet Fuel Market.txt";" The recovery of European air traffic close to pre-pandemic levels expanded the region's supply and demand for jet fuel. Usage jumped to 5.4 million tons in May, a 10% gain from the prior month. Refiners boosted jet output by 16% to 4.5 million tons, with another 3.3 million tons flowing into regional ports from Mideast and Asian producers. Imports were 25% higher than year-earlier levels, when global air travel was still restricted by Covid-19 protocols. Ample supplies lifted regional stocks to 9.2 million tons, 11% higher than year-earlier rates when demand was lower. Most if the surplus versus last year was concentrated in the UK and Italy. Arbitrage volumes have flowed steadily into the UK, which is increasingly dependent on imports. Stocks in smaller countries of the EU also reached record highs.

"2023_8";"Expanding BRICS_ A New Dawn For Global Economic Dynamics _ Analysis.txt";" The 15th BRICS meeting is a key landmark that marks a substantial change in the global economic landscape. This move is mostly related to the addition of new members, which represents a deviation from the alliance's established principles. This development has inevitably raised concerns about its consequences for the global economy, especially in light of the current global economic crisis. This new membership comprises both established countries and emerging economies. The announcement made on August 24, 2023, is very significant in this story of growth. This carefully selected group of new members represents a wide range of geographical areas and economic characteristics, emphasizing the alliance's commitment to supporting a comprehensive and inclusive approach to global economic cooperation. These acquisitions demonstrate the BRICS association's dynamic nature and flexibility to welcome and engage a varied variety of economic profiles. BRICS itself is a collaborative assembly of five major countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—united by their shared status as emerging economies. Beyond their economic affinities, this consortium is characterized by its concerted efforts to enhance diplomatic coordination, advocate for reforms within global financial institutions, and ultimately assert itself as a counterbalance to the prevailing Western hegemonic influence. This collective agenda seeks to reshape the dynamics of global economic and political interactions. What does it mean for global economy? Achieving Economic Enlargement through Inclusion The decision to welcome new members into the BRICS alliance marks a substantial expansion of its economic prowess. Prior to their inclusion, the combined economic output of the BRICS nations stood at around $27 trillion. With the original six members projected to reach a combined GDP of $27.6 trillion in 2023, equivalent to 26.3% of the global total, the addition of these new nations pushes the anticipated GDP to approximately $30.8 trillion, granting them a 29.3% share of the global economy. This incorporation translates to an enhanced economic influence for the BRICS, demonstrating a significant shift in scale and potential impact on the global stage. Diverse Regional Synergy The inclusion of members from three continents emphasizes BRICS' enduring relevance in the Arab and Latin American regions, offering increased economic prospects. Concurrently, Argentina's membership strengthens economic collaboration in Latin America. The participation of Iran and Egypt reflects BRICS' interest in fostering robust economic partnerships in the Middle East. Furthermore, the addition of Ethiopia underscores the alliance's commitment to supporting the development of African nations and fostering economic growth across the continent. Shifting Global Energy Landscape The notable entry of Saudi Arabia and the UAE into BRICS holds significant implications for the global energy sector. Despite global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels, the substantial size of the global oil market remains undeniable. BRICS' amplified involvement in this realm, primarily due to the inclusion of Saudi Arabia - responsible for 12.9% of global oil production - is noteworthy. Based on data from the Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy in 2022, BRICS' share of global oil production is set to surge from 20.4% to 43.1%. This transformation carries the potential to reshape energy negotiations, impacting both the global economy and energy markets. Additionally, this united front may empower the alliance to collectively address energy-related policies, such as sanctions. Enabling Economic Diplomacy in the Middle East The integration of Middle Eastern economies, notably Iran and Saudi Arabia, holds substantial geopolitical and economic implications. These additions could serve as mediators for economic and political dialogues, facilitating smoother negotiations in regions marked by bilateral challenges. Moreover, this expansion opens doors for other Middle Eastern nations to potentially join BRICS, fostering heightened economic engagement across the region. Argentina's accession is equally significant, injecting substantial economic strength into the BRICS alliance, benefiting both the collective and Argentina's individual economic prospects. Prioritizing Engagement in Africa and the Middle East The inclusion of Egypt and Ethiopia into BRICS' fold underscores the alliance's unwavering commitment to integrating African nations into the global economic landscape. This strategic choice aligns with BRICS' aim to counterbalance the influence of other regional actors while strengthening its own engagement. Moreover, BRICS' concerted focus on African and Middle Eastern economies showcases its dedication to nurturing economic growth and stability in these regions, setting the stage for broader international collaboration. Forging New Paths in Global Trade The expansion of BRICS' membership heralds the advent of innovative trade routes and collaborative endeavors. By integrating economies with distinct strengths, the alliance has substantially widened its economic reach. This expansion possesses the potential to invigorate economic progress by facilitating trade among member states and harnessing their diverse economic capabilities. As BRICS embarks on fresh trajectories within the global trade landscape, it positions itself as a dynamic force that is shaping the future of the worldwide economy. BRICS' Penetration into Vital Trade Routes - Suez, Hormuz, and the Horn of Africa The incorporation of Egypt into BRICS' ranks marks a pivotal moment in the alliance's relationship with the Suez Canal, ushering in a new paradigm within the global economic terrain. Simultaneously, the linkage between Iran and the UAE signifies BRICS' entrance into the geopolitically crucial Strait of Hormuz, a conduit that handles over half of the world's energy supplies. Furthermore, the inclusion of Ethiopia as a BRICS member hints at the alliance's future expansion potentially encompassing South Asia, the Middle East, and the broader Indo-Pacific region. This trajectory carries significant weight, as the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea corridor serve as pivotal gateways to the Indo-Pacific. This strategic maneuver appears to be a calculated response by BRICS to the ongoing shifts and consolidations within the Indo-Pacific region in recent times. The Integration of Egypt: Pioneering Economic Ventures The addition of Egypt to the roster of BRICS member states represents a substantial milestone, solidifying the alliance's economic connections to the Suez Canal. This strategic step not only bolsters BRICS' engagement with vital maritime trade routes but also reflects its broader economic aspirations. The Suez Canal, acting as a linchpin between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, plays a pivotal role in facilitating global trade and the movement of goods. By establishing strong ties with Egypt, BRICS is positioning itself to harness the economic advantages presented by the Suez Canal. This calculated move opens avenues for amplified trade and collaboration while positioning BRICS as a central player in the realm of global maritime commerce. Navigating the Geopolitical Landscape: Hormuz and the Horn of Africa The linkage between Iran and the UAE within the BRICS framework holds extensive implications, as it embarks on a journey into the intricate geopolitics of the Strait of Hormuz. This narrow passage, nestled between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, has emerged as a geopolitical hotspot due to its role in facilitating a substantial portion of the world's oil shipments. With its involvement in this region, BRICS steps into a domain where economic interests intersect with intricate political dynamics, necessitating a delicate equilibrium to ensure stability in the flow of energy resources and the safeguarding of global economic interests. The entry of Ethiopia into the BRICS fold introduces another layer of strategic foresight. This move alludes to a potential expansion of BRICS' influence into South Asia, the Middle East, and the broader Indo-Pacific region. The strategic significance of the Horn of Africa and the adjacent Red Sea corridor is twofold: it acts as a crucial gateway connecting the African continent to the Indo-Pacific and serves as a conduit for global maritime trade. As BRICS aligns itself with Ethiopia, it lays the groundwork for prospective economic and geopolitical engagements that extend further afield. Countering the Realignment in the Indo-Pacific: BRICS' Calculated Strategy BRICS' strategic calculus in extending its footprint to encompass vital trade routes and pivotal geopolitical intersections mirrors a concerted response to the evolving dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region. The recent push for greater integration in the Indo-Pacific underscores the strategic and economic importance attributed to this region by major global players. By broadening its reach to encompass the Horn of Africa and aligning with Ethiopia's interests, BRICS positions itself as a counterweight to the burgeoning consolidation in the Indo-Pacific. This deliberate move seeks to establish BRICS as a relevant stakeholder not only in established global economic power centres but also in emerging domains that are shaping the trajectory of international commerce and geopolitics. To summarise, the addition of new BRICS members has far-reaching repercussions for the global economic landscape. This strategic expansion brings together varied economies in a collaborative partnership that promises regional and global economic advantages. BRICS expansion is a purposeful endeavor to change the parameters of international economic cooperation, from changing energy dynamics to promoting diplomatic and commercial partnerships in difficult areas. The world will definitely be watching carefully as the BRICS alliance evolves with these additional members to see the degree of their combined impact on the global economy.

"2023_8";"Headwinds Cloud India 's Promising Outlook for Jet Fuel Usage.txt";"  Storm clouds are building up over India's enormous potential to become one of the world's largest jet fuel markets. The decline in jet fuel usage since May coincided with the bankruptcy of Go First. The low-cost carrier grew quickly to become India's fourth-biggest passenger airline in the 2022/23 fiscal year with a 8.4% market share.  It operated 58 aircrafts accounting for about 10% of India's fleet. Indigo and Spice Jet are not able to operate their entire fleet due to technical problems stemming from supply chain issues. Spice Jet is also grappling with financial troubles. July's jet fuel consumption of 169,000 barrels per day was 1% lower than the current fiscal 2023/24 year's peak in May, according to oil ministry data. Use of jet fuel increased by 13% in the April-July period to168,000 b/d from a lower pandemic-recovery base, the government data show. International passenger traffic will exceed pre-Covid-19 levels in the current fiscal year with the easing of travel restrictions, resumption of direct flights and enhanced work-related travel, said Fitch's India Ratings and Research. Domestic air traffic already surpassed pre-pandemic levels by 12% in the April-June quarter. Flagging Fuel Usage But fuel demand still trails pre-pandemic levels of 173,000 b/d in the 2019/20 fiscal year. With over 100 aircraft grounded for various reasons, fuel usage is unlikely to achieve double-digit growth, a Mumbai-based analyst said. He expects demand to rise only marginally unless local carriers can get more planes in the air. Air traffic is faltering as rising oil prices ratchet up air fares amid tight capacity. India's state-owned refiners increased jet fuel prices by 9% in August from July after Brent crude rose above $80/bbl. This month's prices climbed to 98,508 rupees/kiloliter ($1,201) in Delhi, with further increases expected in September. Airlines were already charging higher rates in the festival season that began in October as more passengers competed for a shrinking number of seats. The number of Indian air travelers was expected to soar to 600 million in 2040 on the back of orders of thousands of aircraft from Airbus and Boeing. India's privatized IndiGo has agreed to buy 500 aircraft from Airbus â€ the largest purchase to date of any airline â€ with deliveries scheduled to start by 2035. In February, Air India placed its own huge order for 470 aircraft from both Airbus and Boeing. Fleet expansion is crucial to meet New Delhiâ€™s projection for a 430 million increase in passenger numbers by 2040 versus 2019 levels. Only around 4% of the country's 1.4 billion people have travelled by air. But now that financial and supply chain problems are casting a long shadow over the sector, India Ratings and Research projection that ""Indiaâ€™s aviation industry is on a high-growth trajectory"" seems overly optimistic.

Peak summer travel season in the northern                     hemisphere got off to a strong start in June                     with double-digit demand growth and average                     load factors topping 84%, according to the data                     by The International Air Transport Association                     (IATA).                                         Total traffic in June 2023 - measured in                     revenue passenger kilometres or RPKs - rose 31%                     compared to June 2022, with the global traffic                     nearing 94.2% of pre-COVID-19 levels,                     statistics from IATA suggested.                                         For the first half of 2023, total traffic was                     up 47.2% compared to same time last year.                                         In terms of international traffic, June 2023                     RPKs rose by 33.7% versus June 2022, reaching                     88.2% of June 2019 levels with H1 2023 traffic                     up 58.6% over H1 2022 while all markets showing                     robust growth.                                         In fact, European carriers posted a 14% traffic                     rise versus June 2022, with load factor                     climbing to 87.8% during the period, which was                     the second highest among the regions, as per                     IATA.                                         Domestic traffic for June rose 27.2% compared                     to the same month a year ago and was 5.1% above                     from the June 2019 results, while demand was up                     33.3% in the 2023 first half compared to a year                     ago.                                         Contradicting the trend in passenger traffic,                     air cargo demand contracted albeit marginally                     in the month of June.                                         Global demand, measured in cargo                     tonne-kilometres (CTKs), fell 3.4% in June                     compared to June 2022, according to IATA, with                     demand sliding 8.1% year-on-year for the                     January-June period of 2023. However, demand in                     June was only 2.4% below June pre-pandemic                     levels.                                         European carriers                     experienced a 2.8% decrease in cargo volumes in                     June 2023, compared to the same time in 2022,                     data from IATA suggested.                                         While cargo demand was down 10.2% for the first                     six months of 2023 compared to last year; the                     half-year capacity rose 2.5%.                                         Drop in June CTKs has been mainly attributed to                     decline in global manufacturing production and                     exports as indicated by Purchasing Managers                     Index or PMI at 49.2 and new export orders PMI                     at 47.1 - both below the critical threshold                     represented by the 50 mark.

"2023_8";"Oil PSUs Clock Increase in Petrol, Fall in Diesel Sales.txt";" JET FUEL SALES UP 10.3% IN JULY New Delhi:State-run oil companies sold 3.8% more petrol and 4.3% less diesel in July compared to the same month last year, with sales being impacted by heavy rains as well as the return of private sector fuel retailers to the market. Jet fuel sales rose 10.3% year-on-year in July as airlines flew more passengers, according to the provisional sales data obtained from state-run oil marketing companies. Consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), prima-  rily used for cooking in the country, fell 1.7% in July.  Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum obtained a larger market share last summer as private refiners slowed sales to avoid selling at below-market prices. As international prices sharply rose last summer, state-run companies froze domestic pump prices, prompting private refiners to reduce their retail sales. Domestic prices have been at the same level since the May of last year while international prices have sharply fallen, allowing retailers to make extraordinary margins of  ` 8-9 on each litre of petrol and diesel sold at the pumps. This has also brought back private sector fuel retailers who are quickly regaining market share. Reliance-BP and Nayara Energy nearly tripled their share of the country's diesel sales to 9.4% in June from a year earlier. Private players' share in the retail sales of petrol rose to 7.8% in June from 6.8% a year earlier. The government releases data for the entire industry by the 10th of each month, which gives a more precise sense of the national fuel demand.

"2023_8";"Optimism over global economy rises among top investors.txt";" Top investors are increasingly abandoning the safe haven of cash and returning to the markets as fears start to ease that the global economy will slide into recession, according to a closely watched survey of big global fund managers. Bank of America said its monthly poll of investors had found that the mood in the international markets was the least bearish since February last year with optimism about the health of the economy starting to increase. More than 40 per cent of fund managers believe the global economy is unlikely  to suffer a recession  in the next year, the most since June last year. As a result, fund managers are moving out of cash and into riskier equities. Cash holdings fell from 5.3 per cent to a 21-month low of 4.8 per cent, while allocations to shares increased by 13 percentage points compared with last month, in the biggest monthly increase recorded since November. The findings point towards changing tides in the markets, which have been disturbed since last year by  rising interest rates  and rampant inflation in Britain, Europe and the United States. The Bank of America poll is considered one of the leading barometers of sentiment among fund managers. This month, 211 investors overseeing assets of $545 billion for institutions ranging from insurers and pension schemes to mutual and hedge funds participated. Investors have been navigating turbulent markets since central banks began in late 2021 to rapidly lift interest rates in a battle to contain price rises. Higher rates  and inflation , combined with fears about the geopolitical ramifications of the war in Ukraine, have created challenging conditions, with global equities and bond markets enduring heavy falls last year. Markets remain volatile, with the FTSE 100 falling 1.6 per cent yesterday after official data showing  record wage growth in the UK  in the three months to June stoked speculation that further rates rises were on the cards. The Bank of England has lifted the base rate to a 15-year high of 5.25 per cent. Concerns that inflation will stay high, prompting central banks to remain hawkish on monetary policy, remain the biggest potential risk preoccupying investors, the survey found. Despite this threat, pessimism about global growth is starting to ease. While a net 45 per cent of investors surveyed expected the economy to be weaker in 12 months’ time, this was down from 60 per cent last month. A similar picture was painted by another survey conducted by the bank and focused on European fund managers, which found that a net 14 per cent of participating investors expected a global recession, down significantly from a peak of 77 per cent in November. Growth is expected to stay meagre, however, with a net 63 per cent of fund managers in the region expecting the European economy to weaken in the next year. This regional survey encompassed 137 fund managers with $273 billion of assets.  Page 2 of 3 Optimism over global economy rises among top investors        "
"2023_8";"Stumbling trade fuels fears of a fractured global economy.txt";"The slowdown in global trade, exemplified by falling Chinese exports and a decline in U.S. imports, primarily reflects a phase of weak global economic growth.      It also raises questions about whether deeper changes are occurring, following decades of deepening global economic integration and now seemingly ushering in a new era in which the West and China do more business with their political friends and less with each other.      Geopolitical tensions, heightened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are leading to more restrictions in the United States and Europe for those doing business with China. However, the magnitude and complexity of global trade and investment links mean that any process of separating the world economy into blocs of like-minded countries is likely to be gradual and tortuous.      World trade is currently at a weak stage mainly because demand for goods has weakened, economists said. Higher interest rates in the United States, Europe and other economies struggling with inflation have also led to a broad global slowdown.      In addition, consumers who spent heavily on goods during and after the covid-19 pandemic are now spending more of their disposable income on services, which, with exceptions such as tourism, are more likely to be offered at home. Manufacturing-intensive economies in Asia are feeling the consequences.      Trade in services is now livelier than trade in goods shipments, thanks, among other things, to a rebound in international travel and tourism, which economists expect to rebound this year to nearly its pre-pandemic level.      Inflation itself is also weighing on trade. Food and energy prices remain higher than before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, reducing the disposable income of people around the world, even though prices for commodities such as grain and natural gas have fallen from their peaks last year.      ""The main cause is probably related to the global slowdown in manufacturing after the big surge that followed the pandemic,"" said Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at LC Macro Advisors and visiting professor at London School of Economics. ""Fragmentation, de-globalization, de-risking will play a bigger role in the coming years and could be very important factors. But I'm skeptical that it can happen overnight,"" Codogno added.      Resilient U.S. consumer demand, helped by strong wage growth, has been a bright spot for the global economy. But the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases are weighing on business investment, including spending on capital goods.      Business data are starting to reflect this. In the first half of this year, total U.S. imports fell 4% from a year earlier, while exports rose 2.6%, the Commerce Department said a few days ago. Imports fell 1% in June versus May to $313 billion, the lowest level since December 2021.      ""While the holiday season could bring some improvement to trade flows, we expect strong headwinds in the form of elevated interest rates, a slowdown in consumer demand and a mild recession to avoid extending the current sustained recovery in 2024,"" Matthew Martin, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics said in a research report.      The International Monetary Fund expects world trade growth to slow to 2% this year from 5.2% last year. The World Bank and the World Trade Organization forecast that trade will grow by only 1.7% this year.      Even a partial recovery in 2024 is forecast to be well below the average annual trade growth of 4.9% during the two decades before the pandemic.      Economists at the IMF and other multilateral organizations mainly blame sluggish overall growth, especially in advanced economies. But they have also expressed concern about the long-term effect of geopolitical rivalries on global trade, with the possible emergence of a trade bloc surrounding China and Russia and others around the United States and its allies.      ""We see the increase in trade restrictions that countries have imposed on each other,"" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said in late July, noting a spread of tariffs and restrictive regulations. ""There is also an impact in terms of direct investment and that is quite important.""      The U.S. is expected to announce new investment restrictions on some Chinese technology companies, a further move to restrict Chinese access to U.S. know-how following last year's restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductors and chip-making equipment.      The Biden administration also kept in place most tariffs on products from China and other countries implemented by the Trump administration.      Many European countries are cracking down on Chinese investment in the region, and the continent's leaders are looking for ways to reduce their dependence on China for critical raw materials and other inputs. But companies in Germany and other countries that have built a heavy dependence on the Chinese market are resisting political calls to retrench.      Western efforts to isolate Russia show how difficult it can be to untangle globalization. Despite sanctions on Moscow and calls for companies to pull out, many European and U.S. companies continue to operate in Russia. Spikes in German exports to Russia's neighboring countries, such as Georgia and Kazakhstan, are fueling suspicions that Russia is still importing many Western products through indirect routes.      On the other hand, European countries replaced most Russian oil and natural gas with other sources, while Russia is redirecting its energy exports to China and other customers, showing how war can lead to rapid changes.      Other recent geographic shifts include the United States and Europe trading more with each other, even as Western trade with China slows; Mexico supplanting China as the United States' largest trading partner; and developing countries shifting their exports to China rather than the West.      The pace and patterns of globalization have changed before. The world economy became rapidly interconnected after the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism, and particularly after China joined the WTO in 2001. For years, cross-border trade and investment increased as a percentage of global economic activity.      But globalization began to stall after the 2008 global financial crisis. Trade no longer grew faster than the overall global economy, but neither did it decline dramatically.   Page 2 of 3 Stumbling trade fuels fears of a fractured global economy        "
"2023_8";"The five global economic shifts happening now.txt";"   At the Jackson Hole  economic symposium last week, central bankers were under no illusion about inflation. Its threat persists, they said, and its outlook is complicated  by structural shifts in the global economy. Normally, the latter argument is simple to dismiss because officials always complain that their period in office is marked by unusual uncertainty. In 2023, however, they have a point. There are five important shifts happening in the global economy right now.  The first and most immediate is a necessary policy adjustment from reducing inflation to keeping it under control. The rate of price increases has slowed sharply in the US and is moderating in Europe, but Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell and Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, were clear that it is  far too early for central bankers to take a victory lap.  Domestic demand in the US is surprising everyone by its strength, which is likely to keep inflation too high if it persists when unemployment is near historic lows. While the current estimates by the Atlanta Fed that the annualised rate of growth is on track to touch 6 per cent in the third quarter are almost certainly wrong, the US economy is running too hot and needs to cool. In Europe,  business is gloomy but prices — especially in holiday destinations — and wages are still rising rapidly, raising the prospect of prolonged stagflation.  Both economies will need time to adapt towards low inflation and sustainable growth rates. This will require higher interest rates for longer until inflationary pressures are definitively behind us.  But judging exactly when the inflation risk is diminishing is all the more difficult now because the second important shift in the global economy is that supply conditions are far from stable.  Long gone are the days when policymakers could understand inflationary pressures simply by constructing the best available indications of demand and comparing these with a constant annual rate of sustainable growth. The pandemic and energy crisis of the past three years have made such analysis redundant.  Instead, economic analysis must encompass extreme supply shifts ranging from coronavirus lockdowns and fractures in global supply chains to energy supply conflicts following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Even in the labour market, the trends are very difficult to assess.  The US had an inflationary dip in prime age labour force participation in 2021, before an encouraging and rapid recovery more recently. France has also seen large improvements in the availability of labour, but these are far from universal, with a reluctance or inability to work still evident in the UK.  The Bank of England is confronting the most difficult trade off, having to deal with supply problems ranging from a persistent shortfall of business investment since the 2016 Brexit referendum, a sharp rise in long-term sickness among employees and an energy crisis. The bank cannot rectify these problems with monetary policy, but needs to ensure demand is curtailed sufficiently to squeeze inflation harder. That will take some courage.  If the BoE has the most pressing problems with constrained supply, the third shift relates to public finances and applies most forcefully on the other side of the Atlantic. Simply put, the Fed must deal with the unwillingness of US politics to show any restraint over its budget.  Ten months into the latest fiscal year, the Congressional Budget Office calculates that the federal budget deficit is more than twice that of the same period the previous year. Cash receipts are down 10 per cent, while nominal gross domestic product is about 7 per cent higher than the previous fiscal year. Compared with a decade ago, the US economy has moved from a relatively tight fiscal and loose money regime to one of loose fiscal policy and tight money. European nations face the same defence, demographic and climate challenges that make a similar shift likely to spread.  Taking a wider horizon, the fourth shift is a requirement to pay more attention to India’s economic prospects. For years, China’s fortunes alongside high-income countries have been dominant in the global economy because it produces more goods and services than any other country and its economy was growing at about 8 per cent a year.  Those days are coming to a close. Although China’s economy is more than twice the size of India’s, measured with purchasing power parity exchange rates, its underlying growth rate is slowing rapidly. You don’t have to predict that China is about to suffer a property meltdown to think that India will soon rival its neighbour,  not only in population, but in its contribution to global growth. That could even happen in the second half of this year and is likely to be the norm by the 2030s.  New Delhi’s move towards the top of the league table of global growth contributions highlights the final global economic shift. India is an outlier with rapid expansion. Elsewhere, productivity growth has slowed, countries are erecting barriers to trade and promoting resilience over efficiency. In this world, normal global growth will slow.  Before the financial crisis, the global economy could expand about 4 per cent a year sustainably. That figure fell to about 3.5 per cent in the 2010s. Now it seems 3 per cent is the speed limit. With the planet’s health in mind, more sluggish improvements in living standards will reduce carbon emissions, but slower global growth will certainly not make it easier to resolve geopolitical tensions.

"2023_9";"China Hikes Oil Products Exports to Boost Economy.txt";" Seeking to boost China's sluggish economy, Beijing has issued a third round of export quotas for 12 million tons of transportation fuels. Chinese refiners have now received quotas to export 40 million tons of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel so far this year, up from total quotas of 37.35 million tons last year. Earlier this year, China had been expected to keep its export quotas for 2023 in check . The increase, and the potential for at least one more round of quotas before the end of this year, signal that Beijing is looking to exports to help revive its economy. ""China needs growth in international trade to support economic growth,"" a China-based analyst told Energy Intelligence.  China's total exports in January-July of this year amounted to $19.45 billion â€ down 5% versus a year ago. Weaker exports have been one of the factors holding back economic recovery in China, which still depends heavily on overseas markets to drive growth. ""China may issue another batch [of export quotas] later this year,"" Chinese energy consultancy JLC's Victor Yang told a seminar in Singapore on Tuesday. ""China is under pressure to give a boost to the economy."" Beijing's decision to allow more export quotas has a recent precedent. It issued higher export quotas in the second half of 2022 as the countryâ€™s economic, and politically-sensitive foreign trade balance weakened, and state refiners lobbied for higher exports to compensate for sluggish demand at home. The Ministry of Commerce has allocated the additional quotas to state-controlled companies, as well as to China's largest private refiner Zhejiang PetroChemicals. Economic Uncertainty Beijing is gradually introducing measures to support the economy, in particular to keep China's struggling real estate sector afloat. Some economic indicators are showing signs of improvement: the Caixin China Manufacturing Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI), which is weighted more towards private enterprises than the official PMI, rebounded to 51 in August from 49.2 in July. While several banks have cut their 2023 GDP growth forecasts to less than 5%, other observers are confident that Beijing's modest policy steps could help China achieve, or exceed, its 5% target. ""A succession of small-scale fiscal and monetary boosts should provide some support. We expect China to grow 5.1% this year,"" advisory firm Oxford Economics said on Friday. Carbon Emissions Postponed The slowdown in economic growth and concerns that the relatively low 5% target could be missed mean that efforts to cap carbon emissions in China's refining industry have become a lower policy priority for Beijing for the time being. The government had started to reduce export quotas for refined products in the second half of 2021 as it sought to rein in emissions by discouraging refiners from running their plants at full tilt. But Chinese refiners ran their plants at high levels to meet rising domestic oil demand in the first half of this year, and to supply feedstock to new petrochemicals plants. China's apparent oil demand rose by 10.5% to 15.25 million barrels per day in the first half of 2023, Energy Intelligence calculates, but growth is expected to be slower in the second half of the year. China's July refinery throughput of 14.93 million b/d was the third highest level on record, according to official data. August crude runs are likely to have risen further, making export quotas for refined products attractive â€ especially as export margins have improved. At the end of July, Chinese refiners had exported about 24 million tons of refined products this year. Chinese energy consultancy JLC now expects China's exports of refined products to rise above 40 million tons in 2023. Page 2 of 2 China Hikes Oil Products Exports to Boost Economy        "

"2023_9";"KBC Bank - KBC Newsletter_ Economic Perspectives September 2023, Global economy.txt";" Global economy Major economies on divergent paths The major global economies are facing different economic realities. In the US, the economy is resisting monetary pressure surprisingly well. Consumption remains remarkably strong and even residential investment is increasing again, unprecedented monetary tightening notwithstanding. Though the exhaustion of post-pandemic savings and the resumption of student debt repayments might bring consumption down in coming quarters, there is increased hope that the US economy will manage to avoid a recession and manage a soft landing. Contrary to the US, the Chinese economy has underwhelmed and has not experienced a major reopening growth spurt. Due to increasing real estate troubles, too cautious stimulus measures and lower exports, economic growth might barely reach the 5% growth target set by the CCP. Furthermore, low consumption - if worsening - might even push China into a deflationary spiral. Finally, there is Europe, where economic growth remains sluggish and inflationary pressures, while decreasing, remain high. Sentiment indicators have reached new lows, especially in Germany. The slowdown is a result of the energy crisis, tighter monetary policy and decreasing global demand. Growth is likely to remain sluggish as the ECB will keep rates elevated this year and part of next year. Gas and oil prices rise Due to disagreements over pay and working conditions, workers at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects (Australia) went on strike on 8 September. The two projects account for 7% of total global LNG capacity. The strike announcement pushed up European gas prices. They reached 32 EUR per MWh in August, 15% higher than a month ago. Prices remain 86% lower than a year ago, however, as EU gas reserves remain well-filled. They are now 94% full, 12 percentage points higher than usual at this time of the year. Futures markets indicate that prices could rise above 50 EUR per MWh during the next winter season. That said, the sky-high reserves and the low(er) probability of harsh winter conditions (given the arrival of El Nino), make critical gas shortages in Europe unlikely. Meanwhile, oil prices rose by 4% in August. Prices have been on an upward trend this summer, rising around 25% in Q3, as production cuts pushed OPEC+ supply to two-year lows. Saudi Arabia and Russia extended their supply cuts of 1 million and 300k barrels per day respectively till the end of the year (at least). Nigeria, another OPEC+ member, also produced around 100.000 barrels per day less due to a temporary shutdown of a terminal. Increased supply in Iran, Iraq and Venezuela aren't enough to offset these declines. On the demand side, higher natural gas prices are driving up demand for oil as oil often acts as a substitute for natural gas. Prices have also been pushed upwards by strong US and Indian demand, and in the background looms the need to eventually refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR). Global food prices declined by 2.1% last month (see figure 1). Despite limited progress on a resumption of the Black Sea grain deal, cereal prices declined by 0.9% as wheat, coarse grains and maize prices went down thanks to a successful harvest. Contrary to other cereals, rice prices, however, increased by 9.8% in the aftermath of India's rice export ban. Vegetable oil prices, dairy and meat prices all declined due to subdued demand in these categories. Sugar prices went up by 1.3% last month, due to heightened concerns over the impact of El Nino on global supply. Euro area inflation slightly down Euro area headline inflation was slightly down from 5.3% in July to 5.2% in August. A larger fall in inflation was prevented by the rise in oil prices. This caused the energy price component to be more than 3% higher in August than in July. Compared to a year ago, this limited the fall in energy prices to 3.3%, down from over 6% in July. Food price inflation decelerated to 9.7%. In contrast to headline inflation; core inflation decelerated further. It fell to 5.3%, erasing the small rise from 5.3% in May to 5.5% in June. Encouraging in this regard are the first signals of some relaxation of services inflation, whose underlying short-term rate of increase, however, is still over 4% year-on-year despite the recent easing. Moreover, services inflation remains the main contributor to headline inflation in the euro area. We continue to expect headline inflation to fall further in the coming months. The most important driver of the near-term decline in headline inflation remains energy price inflation. That would fall sharply in the next few months as current prices will be compared with the very high prices of last autumn (base effects). However, with the recent rise in oil prices, these base effects will be somewhat smaller than initially expected. As a result, we have slightly raised our forecast for average inflation in 2023 to 5.7% and for 2024 to 3.1%. US inflation makes a (temporary) jump US inflation increased from 3.3% to 3.7% in August. Higher energy prices were (again) the prime culprit, as higher gasoline prices drove energy prices up by 5.6% month-on-month. Meanwhile, food price inflation declined from 4.9% to 4.3%. Declining producer prices for food suggest food price inflation might decelerate in the coming months. Contrary to headline inflation, core inflation declined further from 4.7% to 4.4%. Goods prices declined for the third month in a row, thanks to the continued beneficial effect of easing global supply chains and a stronger dollar. Within goods, used cars and trucks declined by 1.2%, the third decline in a row. Forward-looking indicators point to further declines in the months to come, as the Manheim Used Vehicle Index is down 11% from its peak. Strikes from the United Auto Workers could revert this downward trend, however. Another encouraging sign from the inflation front is the moderation in shelter inflation, which declined from 0.44% to 0.29% month-on-month. Though this was in part thanks to a sharp decline in hotel prices, owner-equivalent rent inflation also moderated. It might moderate further in the coming months as US rents inflation (as observed by Zillow, a major real-estate company) were essentially flat in the last four months and are now up by only 3.1% year-on-year. More worrying was the increase in service inflation (ex. shelter and energy services) of 0.5% month-on-month. It remains to be seen whether service inflation will remain at this elevated level. Though average hourly earnings increased by only 0.24% last month, year-on-year wage growth still stands at 4.29%. Furthermore, service inflation has been kept in check by lower health-insurance prices, which declined by 33.6% year-on-year, due to diminishing covid effects (see figure 2). Health-insurance prices are likely to increase again in the coming months. However, the big jump in (volatile) airline prices (+4.9%) might not be repeated in the coming months. All-in-all, given higher energy prices and service inflation, we upgrade our 2023 forecast from 3.9% to 4.1% in 2023 and from 2.2% to 2.5% in 2024.

"2023_9";"No one's laughing about OPEC 's crude joke.txt";"  Rising diesel prices are inflating the bills Brett McMahon is getting from the companies that truck in the plywood, rebar and other supplies his concrete-contracting business needs. Asking his clients to renegotiate contracts to ease that pain, he says, has been ""hit or miss"". ""In the private construction world, you're not going to get a terribly sympathetic ear for that,"" says McMahon, chief executive of Maryland-based Miller & Long. ""It's, 'Hey, you knew the risks when you signed the deal'."" Diesel, jet and marine fuel prices are soaring, squeezing the construction companies, transportation businesses and farmers that are the biggest users. Behind the rise: production cuts made by OPEC and its allies, which have propelled crude prices to 10-month highs and boosted the premiums refiners can charge for making the heavy fuels that power trucks, planes and ships. A growing global thirst for fuel, fading fears of a US recession and last week's extension of Saudi and Russian cuts have propelled Brent crude above $US90 a barrel. Higher petrol prices accounted for more than half of August's 0.6 per cent increase in US goods and services prices from July. The prices of heavy fuels, which are more easily made from denser Russian and Middle Eastern crudes than US shale oil, have risen even more than those of crude and petrol. Energy prices charged by suppliers rose about 11 per cent in August, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That included jumps in prices for petrol, up 20 per cent, jet fuel, which rose 24 per cent, and diesel, up 41 per cent. Jet fuel has risen the most, its price soaring more than 50 per cent on the Gulf coast since early May. Chinese demand has ballooned as Beijing has relaxed pandemic-era travel restrictions, pushing its August jet fuel consumption back towards its pre-pandemic level from below 60 per cent a year earlier, according to the analytics company Kayrros. Delta Air Lines on Thursday warned of higher fuel costs, following similar comments from American Airlines and Spirit Airlines. The concern has been a headwind for airline stocks. The US Global Jets exchange-traded fund has slid 19 per cent since mid-July, while the S&P 500 is little changed. Jet fuel prices might have further to run. Chinese international flight-fuel use is still 40 per cent below its pre-pandemic level, according to Kayrros. Meanwhile, Asian refiners are still working to reverse Covid-era adjustments that reduced their jet fuel output, says Mukesh Sahdev, an analyst at consulting firm Rystad Energy. A tight jet fuel market is buoying diesel and marine fuel prices, he says, since all three fuels derive from the same fraction of the oil barrel. Making a barrel more of one means a barrel less of another. Other problems are constraining the world's capacity to make diesel, including delayed refinery start-ups in Africa and the Middle East and more refinery outages in the US than normal. European refiners have struggled to make enough of the trucking fuel from a diet more weighted toward light US crudes ever since Western sanctions weaned them off Russian varieties. The widening gap between fuel and crude prices has been a boon to US refiners. Shares of Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 are trading at or near their record highs. ""The environment for refiners is just off the charts right now,"" says Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, an analytics provider. Soaring energy prices pose a risk for broader consumer inflation, affecting airline fares and costs for truckers, factories, meal deliveries and other goods and services. Airfares paid by consumers rose 4.9 per cent in August after steep declines earlier in the US summer. Dwindling inventories could keep crude oil prices high in the coming months. The cuts by OPEC+ and growth in global consumption will cause demand to outstrip supply through to the end of the year, according to Rystad, reversing a surplus in the first quarter. The onset of autumn in the US is likely to support diesel prices as homeowners top up heating oil tanks and farmers harvest crops, boosting demand. A heavy maintenance schedule for refineries serving the US northeast could restrict supply, according to Kloza. Federal forecasters recently increased their Atlantic hurricane risk assessment through to November, raising the spectre of Gulf coast refinery outages and fuel price surges. Brent Swart, 45, grows soybeans and corn with his brother on 1600ha in northwestern Iowa. He says he's glad he took his fuel suppliers' advice and topped off his farm's diesel tanks last month.

"2023_9";"OECD Raises Outlook For Global Economy.txt";"   The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised up its growth forecast for the global economy this year based on continued resilience in the U.S.   The Paris-based intergovernmental agency says it now expects the global economy to grow an annualized 3% in 2023, up from a previous forecast of 2.7%.   However, even at 3%, the global economy's growth this year would represent a slowdown from the 3.3% expansion seen in 2022.   The OECD has also lowered its economic growth projections for 2024 as evidence mounts that China's economy is slowing at a rapid rate.  With China acting as a drag on the global economy, the OECD forecasts growth of 2.7% next year, which is lower than a previous estimate of 2.9% growth.   The OECD forecasts that the Chinese economy will slow from 5.1% growth this year to 4.6% in 2024 as consumer spending fades and the property market stumbles.   The U.S. economy is now expected to grow 2.2% this year rather than the 1.6% previously forecast as America proves to be more resilient than most economists had anticipated.  However, the OECD predicts that the U.S. economy will slow in 2024 to 1.3% growth.   In Europe, Germany is expected to be the only major economy that falls into recession within the next year.   The OECD lowered its growth outlook for Europe this year to 0.6% from 0.9% previously but forecast that economic growth will rise next year to 1.1%.   As part of its latest report, the OECD said that central banks around the world should keep interest rates high until inflationary pressures are erased.

"2023_9";"Oil Breaks $90_bbl as Diesel Supply Fears Mount.txt";" Oil markets drew breath after a two-week rally that saw international benchmark ICE Brent futures gain almost 10%. Brent hit a 10-month high of $90.60 per barrel on Sep. 6 before falling back Thursday to finish the week $3.06/bbl higher at $89.92/bbl. US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate held a similar line to close $3.24/bbl higher at $86.87/bbl. The reluctance of traders to take Brent above $90/bbl is likely to prove short-lived given the intensifying tightness in the market.  Saudi Arabia has just pledged to extend its additional 1 million barrels per day output cut that began in July until the end of the year. Its ally, Russia, has also promised to trim its oil exports by an extra 300,000 b/d through December. Diesel markets are already short as Opec-plus supply cuts mainly affect medium and heavy crudes that tend to be richest in middle distillates. De facto diesel benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures went back above $950 per metric ton on Sep. 5, their highest since just before the EU banned Russian fuel imports on Feb. 6. Brokers say diesel prices would probably have gone higher if Beijing hadnâ€™t just issued another round of product export quotas. New permits to sell an extra 12 million tons of diesel, jet fuel and gasoline take this yearâ€™s total to 40 million tons, with another round still likely. Quotas reached 37 million tons last year. Heavy refinery maintenance in the US and East of Suez this fall could still trigger fuel shortages this winter, especially given current low stocks. Jet fuel premiums have fallen sharply in northwest Europe after hurricane supply disruptions proved short-lived. Cargo premiums were pegged at $49 per ton at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from $72/ton on Sep. 1, when up to 500,000 tons of Mideast Gulf jet suddenly looked likely to be diverted across the Atlantic. Actual volumes turned out to be barely 200,000 tons, which traders say Europe can probably spare. Regional airline buying is set to wind down at the end of the summer holiday season while imports remain ample. Kpler data shows at least 2 million tons still arriving in September after a record 2.5 million tons landed in August. Kuwait remains the regionâ€™s top supplier, having put its new refining capacity to work making jet rather than diesel. Jet margins are outperforming diesel in Europe despite winter fuel supply worries. More jet tankers are pointed at Rotterdam this month where depleted tanks are finally starting to rise. At 657,000 tons on Sep. 7, according to Insights Global, Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp jet stocks are still 15% below last year and 22% below the five-year average. No jet cargoes have traded publicly so far in September, with sporadic bidding from Glencore and Shell met with offers from BP and TotalEnergies. BP has the Pacific Rawan coming from South Korea, while Total is showing the Pataris carrying jet from India. Barge market liquidity is also feeble despite a new entrant. Dubai-based E3 Energy has been offering jet barges in the market-on-close window since Aug. 31. Sources say former Koch and Litasco trader Chris Mackenzie is handling jet for E3 from Geneva. US jet fuel markets face major dislocations this fall on many fronts, including drastic cuts in refining throughput due to unplanned outages and a heavy maintenance season. The ongoing drought in the regions surrounding the Panama Canal, a key transit point for transcontinental shipping, is disrupting jet fuel trade flows. With water levels at historic lows, the canal authority is limiting the number and draft of vessels traversing the waterway, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the narrow Isthmus of Panama. Those traffic limits have already caused major delays at both ends of the canal as well as changes to typical trade patterns. Both factors have led to tighter tanker tonnage and higher freight rates. The issue is far from transient. The canal authority said Tuesday that it expects the traffic restrictions to persist into 2024. Tankers using the canal must add an additional 12 days to their typical voyage time, resulting in less available tonnage. Another option is to bypass the canal altogether, either by taking a much longer journey around the southern tip of South America or by diverting cargoes to a different market. While the Panama Canal has faced drought conditions in the past, the severity of the current drought and the anticipated duration of restrictions are unique. Asian jet markets succumbed to falling air traffic in the four largest regional aviation markets East of Suez which sapped prompt demand. But benchmark Singapore spot price differentials remained at high levels following several weeks of strong gains. The Singapore benchmark sank by 16Â?/bbl to a $2.23/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Sep. 7. This is not far below the $2.55/bbl premium reached on Aug. 29 â€ the highest level in nearly seven months. Airline capacity sank in Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia and the Mideast and easily offset a tepid increase in South Asia. Scheduled airline capacity for the week of Sep. 4 dropped by 4.4% in the largest Northeast Asian market, according to OAG. Seat capacity also fell 2% in Southeast Asia and was down by 1.7% in the Mideast. Page 2 of 3 Oil Breaks $90/bbl as Diesel Supply Fears Mount        "
"2023_9";"Opec -Plus Extension Sparks Fresh Price Rally.txt";" Oil futures rallied on expectations that Saudi Arabia will soon extend its unilateral production cut to October. News that Moscow would also announce some form of supply cut for October in tandem with the Saudis fed into the narrative of a tightening oil market in the fourth quarter. International benchmark Brent gained $3.50 per barrel over the week to a more than four-week high of $86.86/bbl at Thursdayâ€™s close. US price-pin WTI put on $4.58/bbl to end the reporting week at $83.63/bbl.  Recent stock draws in the US Federal Reserve into supply-side anxiety. Saudi Arabia has slashed its output by 1 million barrels per day since July while Russia trimmed its exports by 500,000 b/d in July and August and pledged a 300,000 b/d cut in September. Fewer Saudi and Russian barrels come October will squeeze global markets. That will likely place a solid floor under $85/bbl Brent, if not push it to $90/bbl. Distillate markets are on course for severe tightness this winter with big refinery turnarounds planned in the Mideast Gulf and India and the US hurricane season already underway. Europe is facing its first winter without Russian diesel imports with historically low inventories, a hampered refining industry and huge uncertainty about where it can source alternative supplies. New data meanwhile pushed fears of a recession in the US further to the side. Consumer spending in the US rose by 8% in July, while inflation is still trending lower, suggesting the US Fed may not have to raise interest rates again. But Chinaâ€™s fragile economic performance remains a major market uncertainty. Europeâ€™s benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures fell despite heightened worries about winter fuel supplies. Backwardation is bulging from October when the region is due to switch to harder to make winter-grade diesel with cargoes earning an extra $1 per metric ton for every day sooner they can arrive. Jet cargo premiums softened as airline buying got stung by air traffic control problems in the UK and imports on track to remain high through September. Upwards of 2 million tons is already lined up for this month, according to Kpler, versus a record 2.5 million tons landed in August. More than a third of Europeâ€™s jet imports now come from Kuwait. Analysts suggest Kuwait is reluctant to get involved in cut-throat diesel trading despite the capability of its new Al-Zour refinery to make ultra-low-sulfur diesel. Instead the emirate is using its vast aviation fueling network to boost jet exports. Not much fuel is heading to the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp trading hub, where LR2 port infrastructure has been commandeered to handle large diesel tankers coming from the Mideast Gulf and Asia. ARA jet tanks fell again this week, according to stock monitor Insights Global. At 649,000 tons on Aug. 31, jet inventories are now at their lowest since early March and 11% below the same time last year. UK flight numbers collapsed to a third below 2019 levels on Monday after a rogue flight plan apparently crashed the UKâ€™s privately run National Air Traffic System. The glitch caused hundreds of thousands of flights to be cancelled or delayed during the final week of the summer holidays. European air traffic had recovered to within 6% of pre-pandemic levels over the summer, according to Eurocontrol, but the deficit widened back out to 8% this week. The week saw just one jet cargo deal. European major BP sold 30,000 tons likely on board the Pacific Rawan coming from South Korea to Swiss trader Glencore into Rotterdam Sep. 19-23 in Tuesdayâ€™s window at a $6/ton premium to the floating Platts c.i.f cargo mean. BP also offered fuel from the Karimata coming from India alongside Chinaâ€™s Unipec still showing the Amfitriti also from South Korea. Later Saudi Aramco Trading offered jet on board the Navig8 Honor coming from its own Jubail refinery. Only 180,000 tons of jet traded in the market-on-close cargo window during August â€ down 50% on last year and the lowest for the summer month since the pandemic. Year-to-date volumes are still up 33% on last year at 2.16 million tons, according to Energy Intelligence records. The US storm season promises to create major problems for flight and refinery operations. Hurricane Idalia spared US Gulf Coast oil infrastructure this week but did disrupt tankers as it made landfall in Florida. The autumn expected to further tighten up mid-distillate markets and could send jet fuel differentials soaring. Marathon's huge Garyville refinery with capacity of nearly 600,000 b/d is running at reduced rates following a fire. Diesel futures spiked to a seven-month high, sending jet values through the roof. Recent refinery hiccups at Total's Port Arthur plant and Marathon's Galveston Bay refinery had already firmed up the market, while extreme heat has hampered operations at other plants this summer. Moreover, the second-half maintenance season is expected to be heavier than normal. In mid-September Irving's St. John plant in Canada's New Brunswick will be partly shut down. Delta Air Lines is taking its Monroe plant in Pennsylvania completely off line. Airports along the East Coast will be more dependent on imports at a time when Colonial pipeline allocations are well below traditional rates after airlines lost their pipeline history during the pandemic. Asian jet markets also spiked as benchmark Singapore spot price differentials jumped to a six and a half month high. Singapore differentials rose to a $2.55/bbl premium on Aug. 29. The Singapore differential then softened to a $2.39/bbl premium of on Aug. 31 for a 10Â?/bbl gain versus last week. Page 2 of 3 Opec -Plus Extension Sparks Fresh Price Rally        "
"2023_9";"PIIE PROJECTS GLOBAL ECONOMY POISED FOR SOFT LANDING.txt";"After growing 3.4 percent in 2022, the global economy is projected to expand 3 percent in 2023 and 2.8 percent in 2024. A soft landing in most countries is likely but not assured. Analysis presented at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) Fall 2023 Global Economic Prospects finds that while inflation appears to be receding in most countries, it remains decidedly above central bank targets. As a result, most central banks will need to keep their policy rates high over the coming year, with the resulting tight financial conditions holding back demand and slowing economic activity. However, the available information suggests that most countries will experience below-trend-but-positive growth as inflation moderates, not recessions. Outlook for the US economy The US economy has seen more solid growth this year than previously expected, but higher interest rates will dampen growth momentum going forward. Economic activity appears to have accelerated in the third quarter of 2023, but a lull is likely in the fourth quarter owing to the strike by the United Automobile Workers (UAW), restart of student loan payments, and a probable government shutdown. US real GDP is expected to remain below its potential level throughout next year, with growth moderating from 2.2 percent in 2023 to 1.6 percent in 2024 (see figure). Meanwhile the unemployment rate will rise modestly from its current level of 3.8 percent to 4.2 percent by the end of 2024. This soft-landing scenario is consistent with incoming data suggesting that the US labor market has made considerable progress toward rebalancing and that underlying US inflation is subsiding. However, with inflation still well above the Federal Reserve's target level of 2 percent, the Fed is expected to raise the policy rate by a further 0.25 percentage point at its December 2023 meeting to a peak of between 5.5 and 5.75 percent. The Fed is likely to keep the policy rate on hold until the fall of 2024 when the 12-month change in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation sinks below 3 percent. At that point, the Fed is expected to begin to slowly cut rates, with the policy rate returning to a neutral level only after a couple of years. Core PCE inflation (on a four-quarter basis) is projected to be 3.8 percent in 2023 and 2.8 percent in 2024. Outlook for other large economies Most other large economies will see different degrees of subdued growth in 2024. As in the United States, restrictive financial conditions will hold back economic activity in the euro area and the United Kingdom, with the latter having recently entered a mild recession. On a year-over-year basis, UK real GDP growth is projected to decline 0.3 percent in 2023 and 0.2 percent in 2024. European growth may pick up a bit in 2024, but the recovery there remains fragile. PIIE projects euro area real GDP growth to be 0.6 percent in 2023 and 1 percent in 2024. Chinese economic growth continues to wobble as relatively modest stimulus measures are more than offset by lingering effects of the property crisis, weak consumer demand, and unsustainable local government debt. Chinese real GDP is projected to grow 5.1 percent in 2023 and 4.5 percent in 2024. Growth is likely to remain solid in both India (6.3 percent in 2023 and 6.0 percent in 2024) and Japan (1.8 percent in 2023 and 1.3 percent in 2024), albeit slower in 2024 than it was in 2023. Japan's growth has surprised to the upside in 2023, with its economy having experienced a boost from a pick-up in tourism after a delayed reopening from COVID-19. There are three risk scenarios, all of which could eventually result in the United States and some other countries entering recessions: Risk scenario one: Underlying demand (particularly in the United States) may be stronger than the current consensus given potentially sizable amounts of excess savings and support to income from strong labor markets. In this case, the Fed may need to tighten considerably further, which increases the chance of a hard landing. Risk scenario two: Onset of a global malaise in which a European recession, a weakening Chinese economy (and its spillovers to the rest of Asia), and a troubled US banking sector dampen demand considerably further. In this case, monetary policy may not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid a recession. Risk scenario three: Inflation could materially reaccelerate because of developments in global commodity markets that push up energy and food prices or significant further disruptions to supply chains. This scenario would be especially challenging for the Fed and other central bankswith more tightening amid an economy already weakened by the supply shocks.

"2023_9";"Stranglehold Grips East Coast Jet Fuel Markets.txt";" fuel markets on the US East Coast are caught in a stranglehold. The region was already short refining capacity prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and relied heavily on imports, mainly from Canada. Since mid-2019 the East Coast has lost another 330,000 barrels per day or more in refining capacity due to a fire at Philadelphia Energy Solutions and a partial closure of PBFâ€™s Toledo, Ohio plant. Sourcing additional supplies from Canada is not an option now that the Come-by-Chance refinery is being converted to produce renewable fuels.  Heavy Refinery Maintenance Adding to that combustible mix of factors, a heavy refinery maintenance season will take a large chunk of throughput capacity offline in both the East Coast and Canada in the second half of this year. The Delta Air Linesâ€™ Monroe refinery in Pennsylvania and the Irving Oil plant in St. John, New Brunswick are both slated for turnarounds. Delta has maximized jet fuel yields of Monroeâ€™s 185,000 b/d capacity since taking over the plant, while St. John is the largest refinery in Canada with 320,000 b/d capacity and has been a mainstay jet supplier to the East Coast. Unplanned outages have also cut into product yields, most recently a fire at Marathon Petroleumâ€™s 596,000 b/d Garyville refinery in Indiana ran at lower throughput rates in late August. With regional throughput plunging during maintenance and one of its largest import sources shutting down temporarily, the East Coast will become even more reliant on imports from more far-flung suppliers. Data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show that during the first half of 2023 Canada accounted for 19% of Padd 1â€™s 53,000 b/d jet imports. Much of this needs to be replaced, which poses a challenging prospect amid geopolitical issues and constrained downstream capacity. Government data show that the East Coast now imports substantial volumes from Asia and the Middle East. June saw flows from Kuwait at 23,000 b/d, with India, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia also pitching in throughout 2023. Those voyages entail longer timelines and higher freight rates, which could climb higher amid massive delays along the Panama Canal due to low water levels. Supply Chain Pressures With Europe still adjusting to the loss of Russian products due to Western sanctions, mid-distillates have been the chief beneficiaries of supply constraints. The Energy Intelligence downstream model shows jet fuel and diesel are posting the strongest crack spreads in most regions. The US will be competing head- to-head with Europe for imports in the run-up to a potentially cold winter that coincides with high natural gas prices and ongoing refinery outages. Diesel crack spreads could rise further if Europe sources more diesel from the Middle East, Asia, and the US â€ prompting refiners to boost diesel yields at the expense of jet fuel. Sourcing more jet fuel from other US regions is also not an option. Most of the US downstream sector is expected to undergo heavy maintenance after delaying some turnaround projects to capture sky-high margins in 2022. Pipeline and shipping logistics are either strained or not economically viable. The Jones Act limits domestic maritime shipping by stipulating that all intercoastal movements take place on US-built, owned and operated vessels. That rule creates an insulated market that usually prices at a premium to foreign vessels. Airlines refueling at airports along the East Coast are contending with much lower supplies via the Colonial system â€ the traditional conduit for the bulk of their East Coast requirements. Airline and shipper allocations are based on annual shipping histories, which were erased during the Covid-19 pandemic when many flights were grounded and demand plunged. Extreme weather presents another set of challenges for the US refining industry. High temperatures have caused hiccups at some downstream facilities, according to market players. Government forecasters are predicting an especially active hurricane season this year, which poses yet another threat to refinery operations this fall.

"2023_10";"Concerns about jet fuel price spike on projected tight oil supply.txt";"  The crisis in West Asia threatens to broaden into a regional conflict, which will have repercussions on oil supply and a spike in price including that of jet fuel. Oil prices added a war premium as the crisis unfolded, although thus far, there has been no direct impact on physical supply, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). There is concern though that the crisis could broaden to a regional conflict, which would have repercussions on oil supply. Many international carriers halted their flights to the West Asian region earlier this month. The service suspension comes after a robust summer for air travel with revenue growth for international destinations outpacing sales of domestic tickets. The global average jet fuel price last week fell marginally by 0.3% compared to the week before to $121.20/barrel, IATA said in its latest Jet Fuel Price Monitor. The market was also spooked by sanctions imposed by US on two shipping companies, which had violated the $60-per-barrel cap on Russian crude, creating some uncertainty over what that could do to Russian oil supply, the global body of airlines noted. The price of jet fuel has a significant impact on airfares, as it is one of the most substantial operating costs for airlines. Jet fuel is a major expense that directly influences an airline's profitability and pricing strategy and accounts for up to 20% of an airline's operating expenses. Higher fuel costs jack up ticket prices, and conversely, airfare drops with lower fuel costs. A lower fuel burn-per–hour rate reduces the cost of flying an aircraft. The less it costs to fuel an aircraft, the more airlines can reduce ticket prices, obviously attracting more travellers. Analysts say many airlines around the world are reviewing their hedging strategies in view of the situation. Currently, there is a huge demand for jet fuel with the international travel and tourism industry continuing its recovery run to pre-pandemic levels. According to IATA, global origin-destination (O-D) passenger traffic increased 28.9% in second quarter (Q2) 2023 compared to Q2, 2022, reaching 954mn passengers. This brought worldwide passenger traffic near to pre-pandemic levels, only 3.5% lower than in the second quarter of 2019. When jet fuel prices rise, airlines often seek to pass on some of the increased costs to passengers by adjusting airfares. While airlines might not fully pass on the entire fuel cost increase to passengers, they do tend to reflect a portion of it in their ticket prices to help maintain financial viability. Airlines sometimes engage in fuel hedging, a financial strategy where they lock in fuel prices at a certain level for a specified period. Invariably, this strategy provides a degree of predictability in fuel costs, even if market prices fluctuate. If an airline has effective fuel hedging in place, analysts point out it might be able to mitigate the immediate impact of sudden fuel price spikes on airfares. The airline industry is highly competitive, and airfares are influenced by various factors beyond just fuel prices. The price of jet fuel is a critical factor influencing the operating costs of airlines, which in turn impacts their pricing decisions. While airlines often pass on a portion of increased fuel costs to passengers, they must balance this with considerations like competition, demand elasticity, and broader economic conditions. As a result, the relationship between jet fuel prices and airfares is complex and varies based on a multitude of factors. There are perceptions that oil supply will tighten towards the end of the year in view of the crisis in West Asia and the region comprising Russia and Ukraine and the international travel and tourism industry recovering to pre-pandemic levels.

"2023_10";"IMF warns slowdown to hit global economy.txt";" The world economy has lost momentum from the impact of higher interest rates, the invasion of Ukraine and widening geopolitical rifts, and it now faces new uncertainty from the war between Israel and Hamas militants, International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday. The IMF said it expects global economic growth to slow to 2.9% in 2024 from an expected 3% this year. The forecast for next year is down a notch from the 3% it predicted back in July. The deceleration comes at a time when the world has yet to fully mend from a devastating but short-lived COVID-19 recession in 2020 and now could see fallout from the Middle East conflict - particularly to oil prices. A series of previous shocks, including the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, has slashed worldwide economic output by about $3.7 trillion over the past three years compared with pre-COVID trends. ""The global economy is limping along, not sprinting,"" IMF chief economist Pierre- Olivier Gourinchas said at a news conference during the organization's annual meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. The IMF expectation of 3% growth this year is down from 3.5% in 2022 but unchanged from its July projections. It's ""too early"" to assess the impact on global economic growth from the days-old war between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza, Gourinchas said. He said the IMF was ""monitoring the situation closely"" and noted that oil prices have risen by about 4% in the past several days. ""We've seen that in previous crises and previous conflicts. And of course, this reflects the potential risk that there could be disruption either in production or transport of oil in the region,"" he said. If sustained, a 10% increase in oil prices would reduce global economic growth by 0.15% and increase global inflation by 0.4%, he said.  Page 2 of 2 IMF warns slowdown to hit global economy        "
"2023_10";"KBC Bank - KBC Newsletter_ Economic Perspectives October 2023, Global economy - Encouraging signs fr.txt";"  Global economy The world economy continues to run at different speeds: significantly stronger than expected in the US, with first signs of improvement in China, and oscillating between growth and contraction, with timid signs of bottoming out (especially in manufacturing) in the eurozone. At the same time, uncertainty remains high. Structural challenges will weigh on economic growth in China and the eurozone, while headwinds are also uilding in the US. Encouraging signs from China After several months of disappointing activity data in China, September data suggest some upward momentum to growth at the end of the third quarter. Industrial production grew 0.5% month-over-month while retail trade grew 0.31% month-overmonth. Sentiment data was more of a mixed picture, with the S&P global PMIs for both the manufacturing and service sectors declining (to 50.6 and 50.2, respectively) while the official (NBS) PMIs improved marginally (to 50.2 for the manufacturing sector and 51.7 for the non-manufacturing sector). The fact that both manufacturing PMIs are now in positive territory, however, is an encouraging signal for a pick-up in industrial activity. However, the long-standing structural challenges we've highlighted in the past (especially an overindebtedness of the household and corporate sectors) remain an important drag on growth going forward, and the various policy initiatives introduced so far will likely be inadequate to provide a sustainable boost to growth. We therefore maintain our 2023 outlook for GDP growth at 4.9%, just below the government's 5.0% target, and maintain our outlook for 2024 at 4.1%.

The monthly volume was last higher in September 2022 when 610,000 barrels of jet fuel/kerosene changed hands during the Platts Singapore MOC assessment process, S&P Global data showed. On a year-on-year basis, the September traded volume was down 0.66%. Total volume of traded jet fuel/kerosene cargoes over January-September was 2.01% lower on the year at 2.288 million barrels, the data showed. A total of five cargoes were transacted during the Platts MOC process in September. Aramco was the sole seller for all five cargoes, while Vitol, CAO and PetroChina were buyers. The Asian jet fuel/kerosene market saw periods of volatility in September. While traders said regional supply and inventory levels were seen healthy, factors such as expectations of buying efforts from the kerosene sector for the upcoming winter season for Northeast Asia as well as an evolving picture with Chinas export volumes of clean oil products resulted in shifts in fundamentals as the market adjusted and weighed demand and supply balances. Asian middle distillate traders had a mixed view of news reported late September that the Chinese government will not issue new quotas for clean oil product exports and additional allowances for crude oil imports this year, with some saying that this would be supportive for the Asian jet fuel/kerosene market, while others were uncertain. So far, we continue to see Chinese export and jet cargoes being brought to the Straits, a trader said, adding that October jet fuel export volumes from China were being estimated at around 1.8 million mt. Should this be realized, this would be higher than September jet fuel exports which have been estimated at around 1.6 million mt, and even more than the 1.55 million mt for August. Demand is healthy, but supply is too heavy, the trader said, adding that there could be more clarity following the Golden Week holidays in China. The Platts FOB Singapore jet fuel/kerosene crack spread against front month cash Dubai, a measure of the products relative strength to the crude it was refined from, averaged $29.58/b in September, narrowing 2.03% from an average of $30.18/b in August, S&P Global data showed.

"2023_10";"Prices Slump as Attention Shifts Back to Macroeconomic Worries.txt";" Oil futures fell back as the market's attention shifted away from ongoing violence in the Middle East and back to macroeconomic worries. International benchmark ICE Brent futures ended the week $4.45 per barrel lower at $87.93/bbl while US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate shed $6.16/bbl to finish at $83.21/bbl. But a fresh rally is seen as likely. Prices jumped mid-week and again on Friday morning after Israel carried out brief overnight incursions into central Gaza.  A promised Israeli ground invasion into Gaza could ignite a wider regional conflict that has the potential to disrupt the global oil trade and send prices soaring. The US also launched airstrikes on Iran-backed groups in eastern Syria this week in a sign it is preparing for a wider conflict. The European Central Bankâ€™s (ECB) decision to break from a year of hikes and hold interest rates steady at its Thursday meeting failed to give the market much confidence about the prospects for regional oil demand. ECB staffers warned that Europe's inflation was likely to remain stubbornly high for much longer, posing a threat to regional economic growth and therefore fuel buying. A slew of bullish economic data from the US this week was also treated with extreme caution. Surprisingly strong US gross domestic product growth of 4.9% in the third quarter was taken as a sign economic growth had peaked. Traders now fear a retrenchment. Europeâ€™s rollercoaster ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures closely followed events in the Middle East. The front-month November contract finished the week 2.4% lower at $880.50 per metric ton having traded a wide $63.75/ton range. LSGO price swings have been more extreme than Brent with the market on edge after the 15-day hiatus in Russian ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) exports. Fuel is only just beginning to flow again. Russian sales to Turkey, Brazil and markets in north and west Africa are starting to allow more US and Mideast Gulf ULSD to come to Europe. Gasoil tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) fell sharply on a flurry of tanker and barge re-exports to help fill regional shorts. At 1.75 million tons on Oct. 26, according to Insights Global, ARA gasoil tanks are their lowest since last December â€ when the winter heating season was well underway. Regional jet fuel differentials have been exceptionally volatile. Northwest European c.i.f cargoes were pegged at a $69.75/ton premium to November ICE LSGO futures at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from $80.50/ton a week ago and a recent peak of $94.25/ton on Oct. 13. at Thursdayâ€™s close. Airline fuel demand is sliding out of season, but the slump in lifeblood imports has also been extreme. October arrivals into the EU plus UK and Norway are unlikely to exceed 1.7 million tons, down from 2 million tons in September and a record 2.5 million tons in August. Kuwait remains the regionâ€™s top overseas supplier with India, Saudi Arabia and South Korea all vying for a distant second place. ARA jet tanks fell to a six-week low of just 697,000 tons on Oct. 26, according to Insights Global. The week saw just one cargo deal: Chinaâ€™s Unipec selling 30,000 tons to Shell into Le Havre at a $30/ton premium to Platts assessments averaged over the whole of November. A new long-term forecast from Eurocontrol published Oct. 18 expects traffic to briefly return to 100% of 2019 levels next summer ahead of a full recovery expected in 2025. US jet fuel markets facilitated in tandem with volatile ULSD futures. The Nymex contract was pegged at $3 per gallon in early Friday trading, having lost all of the gains posted in the prior week. A spurt in jet demand lifted sales to 1.726 million barrels per day in the week ended Oct. 20, up from 1.6 million b/d through most of October. With output constrained by heavy refinery maintenance, the tighter market took a toll on stock levels. Inventories plunged by 1.3 million bbl to 41.8 million bbl, but were still 16% ahead of the year-earlier mark. Stocks of distillate fuel oils, such as diesel and heating oil, sank 1.7 million bbl for the week to 112 million bbl, even as preliminary weekly data showed that US consumption was 347,000 b/d lower at roughly 4.1 million b/d. Asian jet markets continued to lose ground as benchmark Singapore spot price differentials retreated to their lowest level in nearly three months. Prices weakened even as hefty arbitrage jet volumes headed westwards in the tail end of October. The Singapore spot price differential fell by 17Â?/bbl from a week ago to 53Â?/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Oct. 26 â€ its lowest level since Aug. 4. A total of 3 million bbl of arbitrage jet loaded from Oct. 26-30 from South Korea, India and China, according to Kpler. The volumes are pointed at the US, the Americas, Europe and West of Suez with expected arrival dates ranging from Nov. 8-Dec. 4. Another 473,000 bbl are expected to load on Oct. 29 from Kuwait with destinations in Europe and an anticipated arrival date of Nov. 20. Looking ahead to November, another 2 million bbl are scheduled to load from South Korea and India, according to Kpler. These cargoes are pointed at the US and Europe with expected arrival dates ranging from Nov. 20-Dec. 17. Prompt jet demand is starting to feel the impact of war in the Middle East as airlines cancel flights. Scheduled airline capacity fell by 3.2% in the Mideast in the week ended Oct. 23, based on OAG data. Page 2 of 3 Prices Slump as Attention Shifts Back to Macroeconomic Worries        "
"2023_10";"SK to invest in S.Korean company for bio jet fuel materials.txt";"SK Group, South Korea’s energy-to-semiconductor conglomerate, is set to invest in a local renewable energy ingredient provider for stable procurement of raw materials for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) amid increasing demand for the eco-friendly combustible.  SK Trading International Co., the group’s oil and petrochemicals product trading unit, on Monday inked a deal to buy a stake in Daekyung Oil & Transportation Co. in a consortium with state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) and domestic private equity firm Eugene PE, according to SK Innovation Co., SK Trading’s parent and the conglomerate’s intermediate holding company.  SK Trading, KDB and Eugene PE plan to establish a special purpose company (SPC) to acquire a 100% stake in Daekyung. SK Trading is poised to hold a 40% stake in the SPC, while the two financial investors are set to take the rest. Other details such as an investment value were not disclosed.  “It is necessary to prepare for the SAF sector in advance for a sustainable jet fuel market tracking SK Innovation’s carbon to green strategy,” said SK Trading CEO & President Suh SokWon in a statement.  “SK Trading will not only invest in Daekyung but is also making efforts at home and abroad to become a professional trading company, which stably supplies SAF to domestic and overseas aviation industries.”  The investment is expected to allow SK Trading to secure raw materials for bio jet fuel, the company said. Daekyung is South Korea’s largest supplier of raw materials produced from animal fats and used cooking oil for biofuels.  PLANES POWERED BY FUELS BASED ON ANIMAL FATS, USED COOKING OIL  Livestock fats and used cooking oil are in the spotlight as key raw materials for bio jet fuel amid the rapid growth of the SAF market. Those ingredients, which no governments regulate in the world, reduce more carbon than vegetable materials such as soybean oil.  SAF made from renewable biomass and waste resources is estimated to reduce up to 80% in carbon emissions over the lifecycle of the fuel compared to the existing jet fuel it replaces, depending on the sustainable feedstock used, production method and the supply chain to airports, according to British oil and gas company BP.  SK Group in 2022 made investments in the US-based Fulcrum BioEnergy, which refines synthetic crude oil to SAF.  Global land transportation industries are increasingly using batteries and fuel cells instead of fossil fuels to protect the environment, but the aviation sector has had to keep relying on liquid combustibles due to the limit in battery density and stability.

"2023_10";"The global economy grows slowly and unevenly.txt";" Global economic activity has not yet fully recovered to its pre-pandemic level, with growing divergences between regions. This is reflected in the economic outlook report recently published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the report, the IMF warns that the global economic recovery has weakened over the past year and that economic risks continue to tilt toward more unfavorable scenarios. In this column, I will review this diagnosis, focusing on its relevance to our economy. Compared to the projections in the previous report in July, adjustments have been made to global economic growth expectations, although not of great magnitude. Global growth is expected to decline from the 3.5% recorded in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024. These projections remain below the historical average recorded between 2000 and 2019, which was 3.8%. The forecast for 2024 remains at 2.9%.  .   .  The report highlights the increasing unevenness in economic growth between different regions, with a noticeable slowdown in advanced economies compared to emerging and developing ones. In advanced economies, a sharp slowdown is anticipated, with growth falling from 2.6% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 and 1.4% in 2024. Despite a more robust than expected momentum in the United States, growth is expected to be slightly above 2% in 2023, while in the Eurozone, growth is forecast to be below 1% for the Eurozone as a whole. In contrast, emerging market and developing economies are expected to experience a slight slowdown, from 4.1% in 2022 to 4.0% in 2023 and 2024. Some economies, such as India, Brazil and Mexico, show greater dynamism, while China has reduced its growth forecasts. In Uruguay, projections have been revised upwards due to the drought, with growth estimates of 0.78% for 2023 and 3.1% for 2024 according to analysts, and slightly more optimistic figures from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, with 1.3% for 2023 and 3.7% for 2024.  .   .  Despite the easing of certain extreme risks, such as the banking instability in April, a landscape of risks persists that threatens to worsen economic conditions globally. These challenges fall into two categories: those stemming from longer-term events, such as the pandemic, war in Ukraine and increasing geo-economic fragmentation, and more cyclical factors, such as tight monetary policies to control inflation, fiscal retrenchment due to high debt and extreme weather events affecting commodity markets. These factors raise concerns about the possibility of a period of low global economic growth in the coming years, and some of the lingering risks include: China and the real estate crisis. The crisis in China's real estate sector could deepen, with global repercussions, especially for commodity exporters. The challenge of managing it is complex and requires early restructuring of distressed real estate companies, preservation of financial stability and resolution of strains on local public finances. A sharp fall in housing prices could worsen bank and household balance sheets, which could lead to serious financial amplification. On the other hand, if housing prices remain artificially high, it could hamper other investment opportunities, reduce new housing construction, and negatively affect local government revenues due to lower land sales. In short, China presents long-term challenges based on a credit- and property-driven growth model. Commodity prices. Commodity price volatility could increase due to renewed geopolitical tensions and weather events. Oil prices have risen significantly since June due to OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and selected non-member countries) supply cuts. Food prices remain high and no significant reductions have been observed after the escalation caused by the war in Ukraine. This represents a serious threat for many low-income countries and hinders the disinflation strategy. Inflation. Despite the decline in inflation, levels remain too high. Although near-term inflation expectations appear to be turning around, the risk remains due to tight labor markets, excess savings in some countries and unfavorable energy price developments. Fiscal performance. Fiscal numbers have failed to recover in most countries post-pandemic, due to elevated debt levels, rising financing costs, slowing growth and a growing discrepancy between rising government demands and available fiscal resources. This leaves many countries more vulnerable to shocks and calls for a renewed focus on fiscal risk management. Monetary policy. Despite the tightening of monetary policy, financial conditions have eased in many countries. The danger lies in a rapid repricing of risk, especially for emerging markets, which could further appreciate the U.S. dollar, trigger capital outflows and increase borrowing costs and debt distress. It is the latter risk that is of greatest concern and has intensified in recent months as U.S. interest rates have reached levels unprecedented in more than a decade. Yields on 10 and 30-year bonds in the United States reached highs of close to 5% per annum, levels not seen for almost twenty years. In summary, the international environment continues to be weakened due to existing and more recent risks, such as the real estate crisis in China, commodity volatility, persistent inflation, the erosion of fiscal buffers and monetary policy. These challenges raise the need for coordinated and strategic policy action to ensure global economic stability.  Page 2 of 3 The global economy grows slowly and unevenly        "
"2023_10";"The global economy is limping along.txt";"The good news is that the global economy has proven resilient to the shocks of the pandemic, high inflation and war in Ukraine. The bad news is that it is only limping along, the International Monetary Fund says . Driving the news: The latest installment of the IMF's World Economic Outlook  projects the global economy will grow 3% this year, down from 3.5% last year. Still, its forecast is for inflation to continue receding without a global recession. The report notes that the ""projections are increasingly consistent with a soft landing scenario,"" especially in the United States. The fund's economists see a slew of risks ahead, including troubles triggered by Chinese real estate and volatile commodity prices. What they're saying:""Despite the disruption in energy and food markets caused by the war, and the unprecedented tightening of global monetary conditions to combat decades-high inflation, the global economy has slowed, but not stalled,"" the report said. ""Yet growth remains slow and uneven, with growing global divergences,"" the economists write. ""The global economy is limping along, not sprinting."" Yes, but: The projections were prepared before Hamas' attack on Israel over the weekend created the risk of new geopolitical turbulence in the Middle East. Asked about the potential economic impact, IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said it was too soon to draw conclusions. ""I think we have to be cautious,"" he said in a news conference. ""I think it's too early to really assess what the impact might be."" ""Of course we all hope for a rapid de-escalation and an end to violence,"" he added.

"2023_10";"War & Global Economy.txt";"Too close to and too soon after any ghastly atrocity, blood feuds like what is unfolding in Israel and Gaza may make us believe that we are heading for a 'polycrisis'. 'Polycrisis' is a term used by the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2023 to explain, ""present and future risks can also interact with each other to form a 'polycrisis' - a cluster of related global risks with compounding effects, such that the overall impact exceeds the sum of each part"". The Russia-Ukraine war, the post-COVID debt crisis, global warming, and now the war in the Middle East are all but different elements that make a polycrisis. What will be the impact of a polycrisis on the Indian stock market and Indian economy in general? While the Ukraine and Russia war had arguably had a limited impact on the US stock market riding on AI stocks and India being a swing country (Saudi Arabia being the other one) gained from the surge in its mid and small-cap stocks, the fallout of the Israel and Hamas conflict, if it is not contained swiftly, may have more catastrophic collateral damages to the global economy. There is a fear of a growing risk that other countries will be drawn into this conflict. In particular, if Iran, Egypt, and Syria were to join this religious war - with the presumption that this war is affecting the sentiment of the Arab and Muslim world - the price of crude may spin out of control. The price of crude oil jumped 6% ever since the start of this crisis. The oil price has inched toward $90 a barrel, and there is a likelihood it crossing the symbolic danger mark of $100 a barrel. If the oil price crosses the $ 100-a-barrel barrier, interest rates will stay up higher for longer, not just in the US but in India as well. That, of course, comes with a caveat - if there is no financial accident in the US like any more bank going belly up. Furthermore, the dollar index inching up doesn't bode well for India. If the fickle FII/FPI money rushes out, the much-valorized domestic retail money may hold up the market only for some time. It is to be noted, that for India, crude has the largest share with 30% of the import bill. With a requirement exceeding more than 5 million barrels per day, a rise in crude price beyond the psychological $100 mark will impact the exchange rate and the real economy. Every $10 increase in crude oil price widens India's current account deficit by 0.5%. How much more price of oil will rise will depend upon whether the war spills over to other countries. Although there is an exchange of fire between Lebanon and Israel, it is unlikely that Iran may join the fight directly on religious grounds. It is known that Iran is backing Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon. However, Iran has already gained much from this ongoing crisis. For sure, as the military offense in Gaza continues it is going to scuttle the normalization of the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia. And that by itself is a big win for Shia-dominated Iran, who otherwise may feel left out if Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia joins hands with the Zionists. Iran also fears a normalization of US-mediated ties between Israel and the Saudis will enable the latter to develop a civilian nuclear energy program. In this fast-changing scenario, the Arab world (except for Iran) so far has not supported the Hamas attack on Israel. They did condemn the Al-Maamadani hospital bombing in Gaza but are yet to take an active step as yet. The economy is further going to take a hit, with more than one million Palestinians waiting to enter Egypt. Egypt is the world's largest importer of wheat bulk of which used to come from Russia and Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine war has pushed up the price of wheat, and Egypt is reeling under inflation touching 38% in September. With a weak economy and a high debt, Egypt could not afford to fight a war. For Turkey, which is still recovering from the impact of the deadly February earthquake, the more pressing need is to contain the Kurdish extremism. Moreover, the Sunni-dominated Arab world will certainly not welcome the aggressive stance of the once-dominant Ottoman Empire. With President Biden's visit and the likely easing of the movement of aid and people across the Gaza-Egypt border, the flare-up can be contained. Also, the US and Venezuela agreed on a deal that will ease US sanctions on Venezuelan oil. With a slowing down demand in China and more oil hitting the world market, the price of oil may not cross the danger limit. The market is signalling this as well. Thanks to strong corporate earnings, both the US and the Indian stock markets are so far steadfast. The headline index Nifty fell only 0.7% on the day the market opened after the Hamas attack on 10th October, but ever since then the stock market has been resilient. The oil price has still not crossed the September high number. September wholesale price index (WPI) number shows it continued to fall for six straight months in a row in India. The Indian economy is still holding strong, and let us hope that the emergence of a polycrisis derail this. (IPA)  Page 2 of 3 War & Global Economy        "
"2023_10";"War Premium Deflates Before Strong Comeback.txt";" The war premium on oil prices came back with a vengeance on Friday as traders fretted over what the US sanctions crackdown on G7 price cap violators will mean for availability of Russian crude. Prices had deflated earlier in the week when traders reassured themselves that the conflict between Israel and Hamas wouldn't lead to supply disruptions. Iran is on the periphery of the conflict since it backs Hamas and has been accused without evidence of helping orchestrate Sundayâ€™s surprise attacks. International benchmark Brent jumped by more than $3/bbl on Friday after closing at $86 per barrel Thursday.  By mid-day in New York it was level with $89/bbl where it spiked when markets first opened on Monday morning. US price-pin West Texas Intermediate closed on Thursday only 60Â?/bbl higher at $82.31/bbl before zooming back to $86/bbl in mid-morning trading on Friday. Oil prices are still some $7/bbl lower than they were in late September, when speculative capital was keeping the door open for a rally that saw Brent approach $100/bbl. The IEA energy watchdog sees higher prices starting to erode demand. The agency trimmed its already cautious forecast of demand growth next year from 990,000 b/d to 880,000 b/d in its latest Oct. 12 Monthly Oil Market report. ""Evidence of demand destruction is appearing,"" the report said, noting that preliminary data showed US gasoline consumption at two-decade lows in September. ""Demand destruction has hit emerging markets even harder, as currency effects and the removal of subsidies have amplified the rise in fuel prices,"" it added. Jet fuel demand is now expected to rise just 10,000 b/d next year having rallied more than 1 million b/d to 7.189 million b/d this year compared to last. Europeâ€™s airline jet fuel buying is fading at the end of the summer holidays. But traders report a tighter market as East of Suez arrivals collapse. Imports are currently pegged at just 1.4 million tons this month, down from more than 2 million tons in September according to tanker-tracker Kpler. Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp jet tanks are meanwhile already 10% below year-earlier levels, according to Insights Global. Jet premiums are rising with cargoes pegged at an $86.50 per ton premium to volatile ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures at Thursday's close, up from $58.25/ton a week ago. New forecasts from the regionâ€™s air network manager Eurocontrol, meanwhile, show European air traffic still struggling to get back to pre-pandemic levels. â€?The base scenario for the beginning of 2024 is for between 97% and 98% of 2019 levels, [but] there remain downside risks, for example, on the economy, fuel and ticket prices and market sentiment,â€ it warned when releasing its forecast to March 2024. A full recovery isnâ€™t expected until 2025 when the EUâ€™s new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending mandate will begin to erode demand for fossil jet. Air traffic was 5% below 2019 levels this week after multiple carriers halted services to Israelâ€™s Tel Aviv airport. The week saw just two public jet fuel cargo deals, both with Swiss trader Glencore selling to European into-wing heavyweight BP. BP paid a $74 per metric ton premium to November ICE LSGO futures for 30,000 tons delivered into Rotterdam Oct. 16-20 in last Fridayâ€™s window. It went on to pay a $19/ton premium to Plattsâ€™ Oct. 21-27 assessments for the same volume delivered into the UKâ€™s Isle of Grain Oct. 31-Nov. 4 in Tuesdayâ€™s window. LSGO futures have been on a roller coaster. Prices fell after Moscow's 15-day ban on diesel exports was lifted Oct. 6 and were slow to react to the war in the Middle East. While European traders canâ€™t buy Russian diesel, its sale to Turkey, Brazil and markets in Africa allows more US and Mideast fuel to come to Europe in its place. Gasoil tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp fell 5% to 1.827 million tons on Oct. 12, according to Insights Global. Tanks are still 11% higher than last yearâ€™s seriously depleted levels but 30% below the average for the previous five years. US jet fuel markets have settled into the shoulder season, reflected by shrinking volumes for demand and supply. Jet sales dipped below 1.5 million b/d in the week ended Oct. 6, according to EIA data. Output also fell to 1.56 million b/d as refinery maintenance season intensifies. Crude throughput fell by nearly 400,000 b/d to 15.2 million b/d with utilization rates descending to 85.7% of capacity versus 90% in September. Markets are nonetheless well-supplied with inventories climbing 19% above year-ago levels amid a steady flow of imported cargoes into the East Coast. Tanks in that region jumped another 1.2 million bbl in the first week of October to 12.6 million bbl â€ 50% above the year-earlier mark. A favorable trans-Atlantic arbitrage has kept the East Coast flush with jet fuel. Those imports have offset lower deliveries up the Colonial network after shippers lost the pipeline history during the pandemic that determines annual allocations. Asian jet markets also retraced their steps as benchmark Singapore spot price differentials at one point sank to a two-month low. Lower air traffic in the four largest regional aviation markets East of Suez weighed down jet demand. Singapore differentials dropped to a $1.18/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Oct.10 before recovering to $1.41/bbl Oct.12 â€ a 7Â?/bbl decline from a week ago. Scheduled airline capacity for the week of Oct. 9 slumped by 3.6% in Northeast Asia, according to OAG. Seat numbers were down by 1.4% in South Asia, edged 1.2% lower in Southeast Asia and sank by 1.5% in the Mideast, OAG data show. Page 2 of 3 War Premium Deflates Before Strong Comeback        "

"2023_11";"A Focused Shell Slashes Spending, Eyes Growth Areas.txt";"  Highlight: For Shell, the road ahead means concentrating on areas where it sees a competitive advantage, such as the production of sustainable aviation fuel.  As Shell spends less while fulfilling its powering progress strategy, the company is exiting some areas but planning to grow in others. “We’re pulling back on our capital in an effort to really get very focused and disciplined,” ShellUSA President Gretchen Watkins said Nov. 7. Under its new CEO Wael Sawan, the London-headquartered energy company has lowered its capex outlook to $23 billion to $25 billion for 2023, planning to spend about $3 billion to $4 billion less through 2024. Overall opex is expected to fall as well, down by $2 billion to $3 billion by year-end 2025, Watkins said during the Reuters Energy Transition North America conference in Houston. The shift comes as the company aims to please investors, returning about $23 billion to shareholders so far this year, and strives to profitably decarbonize. Energy companies are being challenged to meet global energy needs while reducing emissions and growing profit—a tall order for some when uncertainties are added to the mix. For Shell, the road ahead means concentrating on areas where it has a competitive advantage. “Focus means we’re going to start doing some things. … It also means we’re going to stop doing some things,” Watkins said, noting Shell has divested out of Pakistan. The company said Nov. 1 it agreed to sell its 77.42% majority interest in Shell Pakistan Ltd. to Wafi Energy LLC. It is also exiting the retail power market in Europe. “So, you’ll see us make those sorts of decisions to really make sure we got a portfolio that is able to perform.” Accounting for about a third of Shell’s capital spend, the U.S. will continue to see significant amounts of capital from the company, Watkins said. She pointed out how the Inflation Reduction Act incentives, specifically tax credits, enabled the company to see through new lenses the economics of technologies such as carbon capture and renewable fuels. Finding competitive advantages As a longtime producer and marketer of jet fuel, Shell sees opportunity to scale up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the U.S., Watkins said, calling aviation an area where Shell has competitive advantage. The company is eyeing certain pilot technologies that would allow it to advance SAF, she said. “SAF is not being produced at scale anywhere in the U.S. or really in the world yet, but there’s a lot of work going on to be able to scale that up,” Watkins said. “We’re optimistic that we’ll be part of that and are working closely with our customers. … It’s not something you can say if we build it, they will come. We actually need to really collaborate on that.” SAF, made from non-petroleum feedstock such as municipal waste and plant oils, have similar physical and chemical properties as jet fuel but with a much lower carbon footprint. It can also be blended with jet fuel. The U.S. aims to produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable fuel per year by 2030, reducing aviation emissions by 20%, and up to 35 billion gallons per year by 2050. SAF is currently used at two major airports, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, but accounts for less than 0.1% of the jet fuel used by major airlines. Costs are among the barriers. Data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) shows only 0.24 megatonnes of SAF was produced globally in 2022. Despite the higher cost compared to conventional jet fuel, airlines purchased all of the SAF supply, IATA said in a report. Demand continues to rise as airlines work to reduce emissions. United Airlines, for example, has said it plans to use 10 million gallons of SAF this year, about triple the amount it used in 2022. “Within a competitive market framework, increased production levels and expansion of the feedstock mix should exert downward pressure on SAF prices, progressively closing the gap to fossil-based jet fuel and easing the financial burden on airlines,” IATA said. Earlier this year, Shell said it signed a multiyear offtake agreement for SAF with U.S.-based Montana Renewables, the largest producer of SAF in North America, to meet supply agreements with Delta Airlines, Alaska Airlines and JetBlue at Los Angeles International Airport. Shell is also a founding investor of LanzaJet Inc., a Chicago-headquartered sustainable fuels tech company and producer. The LanzaTech spinoff is nearing the 2024 startup of its Freedom Pines Fuels, which will be the world’s first alcohol-to-jet SAF production facility. The facility in Georgia will produce 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel per year from ethanol. Continuing oil, gas investment While Shell sees competitive advantage in SAF, carbon capture and hydrogen given its presence in industrial areas such as Louisiana, the company maintains oil and gas will still be needed to meet energy needs. “We are going to be continuing to invest in hydrocarbons,” Watkins said, calling the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) one of Shell’s foundational businesses. “We’re the largest operator in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. You will see us continue to invest significant amounts of capital over the coming years.” Shell brought its Vito floating production facility in the GoM onstream earlier this year, producing about 100,000 boe/d. The Shell-operated Whale, a nearly identical development underway in the GoM, is scheduled to start producing oil in 2024. “We’ve really mastered, I would say, sort of a low-cost way of operating in the Gulf of Mexico,” Watkins said. “But the other really important thing about the Gulf is that the hydrocarbons that come on shore and are consumed by Americans are the lowest carbon footprint of any hydrocarbons we can have.”    Page 2 of 3 A Focused Shell Slashes Spending, Eyes Growth Areas        "
"2023_11";"Aviation must make these changes to meet long-term emissions goals.txt";"  World Economic Forum has issued the following press release: The aviation industry is responsible for 2% of total CO2 emissions and 12% of emissions from transport.Leading airlines, air freight companies and corporate flyers aim to surface supply of sustainable aviation fuels to significantly cut down their emissions.Here ’ s what First Movers Coalition aviation members are doing to meet net-zero targets for the industry.Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the most promising means for an airline to accelerate progress towards a net-zero future. This liquid drop-in fuel, made using feedstocks like waste oil and fats, and biomass, can decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently contributes 2% of total CO2 emissions and 12% of emissions from transport on an annual basis. But while SAF can reduce CO2 emissions from flying by up to 80%, it only comprises less than 1% of total jet fuel demand. Establishing a market for SAF requires increased investment from offtakers like airlines and even corporate flyers, who can purchase certificates for SAF, to scale supply. Have you read?What is sustainable aviation fuel and why are only 0.1% of flights powered by it?What will it take to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel in the next decade?First Movers Coalition: Engaging suppliers for sustainable aviation and beyondThe First Movers Coalition (FMC) is working to decrease emissions across seven hard-to-abate sectors responsible for about 30% of global emissions – aviation included – using the power of demand. By committing to purchase near-zero emissions products and clean technologies, members send a powerful signal to producers to invest in and increase production of innovative solutions like SAF, ultimately increasing their availability and accelerating their commercialization tipping point. Members are adopting the following solutions – and their example shows what ’ s needed to make long-term change possible. Developing book-and-claim systems to encourage SAF uptakeA book-and-claim system is a chain of custody, or certificate trading model, which supports uptake of SAF even though supply chains are limited in geographical scope and volumes are low. This mechanism permits airlines, corporate flyers and purchasers of air freight to purchase environmental attributes of SAF and signal demand for SAF without necessarily flying on it physically. In 2022, American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) partnered with Shell Aviation to launch Avelia, one of the first live blockchain powered book-and-claim platforms for SAF, and part of one of the world ’ s largest SAF programmes. Bank of America recently announced that through platforms like Avelia, it has been able to purchase SAF and work towards fulfilling its goal of carrying 20% of corporate travel on flights powered by SAF. Furthermore, Bank of America has committed to investing $2 billion to support production of 1.2 million gallons of SAF per year starting 2025; Avelia has brought the bank closer to achieving this. Andrew Crawley, President of Amex GBT, said: “Bringing together airlines and businesses, Amex is working to spread the environmental benefits of SAF across the aviation value chain while helping generate the scale of demand necessary for the sector to achieve net-zero by 2050. ” Investing in innovative technology solutionsTo make direct investments in production, United Airlines Ventures (UAV) this year launched a Sustainable Flight Fund, offering a way for companies and consumers to come together to increase the supply of SAF by providing support to start-ups focused on SAF production. The fund started with $100 million in investments and has now grown to nearly $200 million in investment power from 13 organizations across the aviation value chain who have partnered with UAV in the fund to support production of more than 5 billion gallons of SAF. “United has invested in seven companies so far”, says Lauren Riley, Chief Sustainability Officer of United Airlines. These include companies like CEMVITA and Dimensional Energy deriving SAF from carbon dioxide using synthetic biology and another, NxtClean Fuels, prioritizing use of organic feedstocks to produce SAF. Testing and investing in these innovative technologies and alternative feedstocks for SAF production will shed light on pathways for scaled supply. Full value chain collaborationIn August of 2023, Delta joined forces with Bank of America, Ecolab, Xcel Energy and Greater MSP to establish the Minnesota SAF Hub, the first large-scale SAF Hub in the US with collaboration among key players across the value chain committed to scaling SAF production to replace conventional jet fuel. These anchor partners are joined by other leading institutions, including the State of Minnesota, to implement an ambitious shared strategy for aggressively decarbonizing the airline industry. The Minnesota SAF Hub is initially focused on bringing commercial-scale volumes of affordable SAF to the Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) International Airport by 2025. It ’ s accomplishing this by taking a full value-chain approach to decarbonizing aviation – liaising with agricultural players at the very start of the SAF supply chain and ending with airlines demanding less-emitting fuels. In addition, over the next decade, the Hub is also focused on establishing multiple SAF production facilities in Minnesota. As Amelia Deluca, Delta Air Lines ’ Chief Sustainability Officer, said: “The very definition of being innovative is to introduce new ways of doing things from something that ’ s already established. There is no industry that ’ s embraced that idea more than aviation. ” Shared commitmentsThe FMC has helped spur momentum for change thanks to shared commitments and targets that can scale progress. In November 2021, during COP26, 14 airlines and corporate flyers signed a commitment to adopt emerging technologies including SAF to reduce their emissions by 2030. Airlines and air freight companies made an ambitious pledge to replace at least 5% of their conventional jet fuel demand with SAF that reduces life-cycle GHG emissions by at least 85% in comparison to conventional jet fuel (SAF85) by 2030. In the same vein, purchasers of airfare and air freight pledged to replace at least 5% of their demand for air transport using SAF85 by 2030. Both commitments also make room for additional emissions reduction benefits from zero-carbon emitting propulsion technologies. Today, the FMC aviation sector membership has grown to 27 members and counting. If these members are able to achieve these commitments, an estimated 9.6 million tonnes per year of GHG emissions will be avoided by 2030.

"2023_11";"Demand_ Oil Demand Growth Set to Decelerate After Sturdy 2023.txt";" Global oil demand for the remainder of 2023 is unlikely to exhibit any significant upside, even if some large countries like the US and China still show resilience. Demand growth for the year is expected to reach 2.25 million b/d to 100.6 million b/d, a notch higher than last month . The baseline demand number is higher after upward adjustment to Saudi Arabiaâ€™s oil consumption, mostly LPG and jet fuel, by 100,000 b/d in 2021 and 150,000 b/d in 2022. Global demand in 2024 is seen at 102.7 million b/d, a growth of 1.05 million b/d for the year. An embattled global economy (inflation, recession risk, trade wars) is growing in 2024 but will struggle to push demand much above its long-term, average growth level of 1 million b/d per year. Global liquids consumption has grown from 86 million b/d in 2008 to 101 million b/d in 2023, as low interest rates enabled governments to shower their economies with fiscal stimulus that pumped up oil demand. Stubborn inflation would keep interest rates higher for longer and demand-boosting largesse would become difficult to sustain.  In the OECD, fiscal policies and debt levels â€ mainly in the US â€ look unsustainable. Non-OECD registered a 429,000 b/d slump in the third quarter, with a significant 1 million b/d demand drag from Asia Pacific quarter on quarter, but more traction from the Middle East (+354,000 b/d) and from Latin America (+204,000 b/d). OECD regions have held up well over the quarter but preliminary October data show that European demand fell by nearly 800,000 b/d compared to September, with a drop in EU demand making up for 77% of that. Chinaâ€™s product consumption dropped by a sizeable 833,000 b/d quarter on quarter but still increased by a whopping 1.28 million b/d compared with the same quarter in 2022, reflecting in large part the lower base effect from Covid-19. Likewise, Indiaâ€™s demand is also down by 303,000 b/d quarter on quarter but gained more than 200,000 b/d on the year. For emerging markets, higher interest rates and a stronger US dollar dramatically increase the cost of debt servicing and energy imports. That does not bode well for product demand growth, even if these countries are now in a better position to outgrow developed economies. Outside of the jet fuel market, and mostly in Asia, there is only limited pent-up demand remaining from the Covid-19 days. China still is below pre-pandemic jet fuel levels for international flying. So are Thailand and to some extent, Australia and Japan. Excess short-term inflation may be better controlled, but the world has to deal with the effect of protracted trade wars between the US and China, or Europe and Russia. The resulting cost of reshoring supply is staggering and only adds up to the already huge expense of the net-zero energy transition. It also means that global trade is set to grow less, from 6% in 2023 to only 2% in 2024. There is a risk that an economic slowdown may also coincide with a structural regime change, just when a low-interest period rolls into a higher-interest rate period. Add the structural weakness of Chinaâ€™s economic model, widely exposed by the failure of its property sector and more fragmented geopolitics, and there may less room for a lot of extra oil demand growth.

Jet fuel is a specialized type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircraft with jet engines. It is a highly refined and purified form of kerosene, a type of hydrocarbon. Jet fuel is a critical component in the aviation industry, as it powers a wide range of aircraft, from small regional planes to large commercial airliners and military jets. Request Sample Pages: North America is expected to exhibit CAGR of 4.2% during 2022-2031. North America accounts for the largest share of the market, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific. Top Companies The increase in demand from military sector and rise in air transportation are expected to be major factors contributing to the market growth. New flight routes and new airports also surge the demand for fuel, which further drives the jet fuel market growth. Rapid industrialization, modernization and spread of information through internet led to the development of tourism industry which has fueled the jet fuel market opportunities. Stringent rules regarding use of fuel variants and additives owing to high level of carbon emissions and fluctuations in crude oil prices are the factors that largely hamper the jet fuel market growth. Biofuels that can significantly reduce carbon emissions and emerging sustainable jet fuel (SAF) that are under research & development offers lucrative opportunities for jet fuel industry growth. Enquiry Before Buying: The alternate environment-friendly sources for jet fuel production are expected to greatly impact the jet fuel industry in the future. The jet fuel possesses better quality than fuels used in other modes of transportation. They are produced in different combinations of kerosene, kerosene-gasoline, kerosene-biofuel, and others. The fuels used in aviation reduce the risk of icing or explosion due to high temperature, which is obtained by incorporating some additives such as corrosion inhibitors and others. Jet fuel is primarily used by most of the military aircrafts and commercial airlines to maximize fuel efficiency and to lower the operational cost. Aircraft industry is expanding nowadays, which is increasing competition among aircraft jet fuel production in all sectors. Jet fuel is a type of aviation fuel that is designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. It is colorless to straw colored in appearance.

"2023_11";"KBC Bank - KBC Newsletter_ Economic Perspectives November 2023, Global Economy.txt";" Global Economy Q3 GDP global figures: two hits and a miss Q3 GDP figures accentuated the major growth divergences in the global economy. On the positive side, the US economy remains buoyant as GDP increased 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, thanks to strong consumption, high inventory growth and lavish government spending. China's GDP also surprised positively. Its GDP grew 4.9% over a year ago, putting the 5% growth within reach. The euro area's GDP figure disappointed unfortunately, declining -0.1% likely due to lower exports, lacklustre internal demand and inventory growth. Economic growth figures are likely to converge somewhat in the coming quarters. In the US, continued monetary tightening, the depletion of covid savings and the resumption of student debt repayments are likely to put a drag on growth. In China, the real estate crisis is likely to keep growth subdued. Meanwhile, European growth is likely to remain sluggish, as the energy crisis and monetary tightening extract a toll. Further ahead we expect a gradual economic recovery. Energy markets rattled by Israel-Hamas conflict Oil markets were highly volatile last month, reaching 85.6 USD per barrel at the end of October, down 9.6% versus a month ago (see figure 1). Earlier last month, oil prices declined as the US and Venezuela made significant progress on sanctions relief and the dollar strengthened. However, oil prices spiked again as the Israel-Hamas conflict erupted on 7 October. As Israel is not an oil producer, its military operations in Gaza should not disrupt supply if it remains contained. If the conflict were to spread across the region and turn into an Iran-Israel proxy war, however, sanctions on Iranian oil exports are likely to be tightened and oil shipping through the strait of Hormuz could be threatened. Oil prices are thus likely to fluctuate hard in the coming months. Gas prices have also been impacted by the ongoing conflict. They rose 27% last month to 45 EUR per MWh. Israel has two major gas fields, producing 22 billion cubic meters of gas each year (0.5% of global gas consumption). Furthermore, if the conflict escalates, LNG supplies coming from the wider Middle East (especially from Qatar) could be threatened. Gas prices have also been under pressure due to disruptions on a gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia. Furthermore, even though Australian unions at LNG facilities and Chevron management have found an agreement on pay, the threat of further strikes looms large over gas prices. Nonetheless, sky-high EU reserves (at 99%) provide a nice cushion to avoid major gas disruptions this winter. Looking further ahead, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published its 2023 world energy outlook this month. In the report, it stated that demand for all major fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) is on track to peak by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, investment in clean energy has risen by 40% since 2020. In its Stated Policies Scenario, it forecasts global temperatures to rise by 2.4 °C (0.1 °C lower than projected last year). This remains much higher than the 1.5 °C global target. The IEA still believes this 1.5 °C target can be reached and that technologies available to reach it are cost-effective. However, reaching this target will still be difficult and requires further global action and sizeable investments.

The report is an invaluable source of market intelligence, helping to identify the largest markets, key growth markets, as well as potential laggards. In partnership with the British Valve and Actuator Association, this latest edition of our annual Global Valve and Actuator Market Outlook highlights that across most markets, fundamental demand conditions for valve and actuator consumption remain soft. Global nominal growth in demand for valves is set to slow to 2.3% next year, after expanding by 2.8% in 2023. Tight monetary policy will continue to weigh on economic activity, limiting activity in valve end-use markets and investment spending more generally. A correction to producer prices has also meant some country forecasts, especially in Europe, are weaker in nominal terms than in real. A similar downbeat picture can be seen for actuators where world nominal demand is set to expand by 2.7% this year before slowing to growth of 2% in 2024. The full report contains forecasts for consumption of valves and actuators (also often referred to as the market size) across 85 countries at a granular level (valve types include pressure reducing, check, safety/relief, other) out to 2027.

"2023_11";"Risks starting to creep in to global financial system, IMF warns; Economics; Global Trade.txt";" The global financial system has thus far proven resilient to the stress of rising interest rates and other economic challenges, but risks are starting to creep in, the International Monetary Fund is warning. Speaking at a Bank of Canada event Nov. 7, IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said that a number of problem spots are looming on the horizon, from U.S.-dollar dependence to the siloing of global trade. The Financial Post's Denise Paglinawan breaks down some of the key take-aways from Gourinchas' speech. The death of the U.S. dollar's dominant position at the centre of trade has been greatly exaggerated through the years, with foreign demand for greenbacks growing unabated. That has created a system Gourinchas said is ultimately self-reinforcing - the more foreign firms and governments need the U.S. dollar to effectively execute transactions, the more they'll have to manage their own currencies in order to obtain said dollars. Without that stability, longer-term planning becomes difficult, which creates overall economic uncertainty. Given that demand, Gourinchas said the IMF believes something of a ""global financial safety net"" is needed - basically a way to provide liquidity in U.S. dollars during times of stress, so individual economies don't grind to a halt. Put simply, if a country can't obtain the right currency to match its liabilities and creditors refuse an alternative payment, the country is stuck. As it stands, countries are mostly engaged in what Gourinchas said amounted to ""self-insurance"" - it's up to them to keep the right currencies on the books. With those factors at play, Gourinchas said there's a tricky balancing act in terms of how to meet U.S. dollar demand in this environment. While the U.S. government is generally able to borrow at the lowest possible rates available, as it's seen as the least likely entity to default, it sells bonds in order to issue the U.S. dollars the world demands. While it often turns around and uses some of that cash to buy back previously issued bonds for cancellation, the current interest rate and debt environment has never been seen before. Those distortions, set off by the pandemic, make this a tricky environment to navigate when it comes to such transactions.

"2023_11";"Star Petroleum predicts global oil price drop despite high energy demand.txt";"  Star Petroleum Refining Plc predicts a decrease in global oil prices for the remainder of the year despite robust energy demand. The reduction in prices is anticipated due to a potential surplus among key oil producers, according to Sakchai Thamsuruk, the manager for supply and planning at the petroleum company. The global oil industry is closely observing Saudi Arabia and Russia's decision on whether to cut crude oil supply by 1.3 million barrels daily. Should they opt against this, a surplus would flood the global market. Despite the traditionally high oil demand during winter for heating purposes, Thamsuruk believes this year's demand will not surpass supply. Geopolitical tensions, such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, while not in the vicinity of major oil sources, could disrupt oil transportation near the contentious Gaza area. Additionally, the economic conditions of powerhouse nations such as the US and China are under scrutiny as they could influence global oil demand in the year's final months. These uncertainties may cause oil price fluctuations, warns Thamsuruk. In the global refined oil market, jet fuel demand is roughly 80% of pre-pandemic 2019 volumes. Diesel demand is predicted to rise in Western countries during the winter. Despite a decrease in gasoline exports from China, Thamsuruk believes gasoline supply will remain stable as driving activities typically reduce during winter. In Thailand, prices of gasohol 91 and gasohol 95 have seen a decrease four times since November 1, dropping from 37.98 and 38.25 baht per litre to 34.48 and 36.25 baht per litre respectively within ten days, as reported by the Energy Policy and Planning Office. This is partly due to the state's policy to reduce gasohol prices, a blend of gasoline and ethanol, which was implemented on November 7 and is set to continue until January 31, 2024. To keep diesel prices below 30 baht per litre and cap liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at 25.87 baht per kilogramme, the government is using money from the Oil Fuel Fund to subsidise LPG by 7.34 baht per kilogramme and diesel by 2.76 baht per litre. This is in contrast to the market price of 33.21 baht per kilogramme for LPG.  Page 2 of 2 Star Petroleum predicts global oil price drop despite high energy demand        "
"2023_11";"With a resilient world economy, Global Economic Barometers grow in November, says FGV.txt";" The Global Antecedent and Coincident Economic Barometers rose in November, the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) reported. ""The Global Antecedent Barometer suggests a continuation of the phase of acceleration in the world growth rate between three and six months ahead. The Coincident Barometer, on the other hand, although showing resilience in growth despite monetary tightening in several countries, is below its historical average level,"" said the FGV. The Global Coincident Economic Barometer rose 1.7 points in November, to 90.8 points. The Antecedent Global Economic Barometer advanced 0.6 points to 102.7 points, the highest level since September 2021. Despite the improvement in both indicators, the difference between the two Global Barometers remains above 10 points for the third consecutive month. ""The world economy remains resilient in the fourth quarter of 2023, although performance is heterogeneous between regions. The acceleration captured by the Global Antecedent Barometer should continue in the coming months, driven by the acceleration in Asian growth. But it is important to note that over the last few weeks the degree of economic uncertainty has increased with the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East and the risk of a longer than expected cycle of monetary tightening in the United States,"" said Aloisio Campelo Jr., a researcher at the Brazilian Institute of Economics at FGV (Ibre/FGV), in an official statement. The Coincident Barometer reflects the current state of economic activity. The Antecedent Barometer sends out a cyclical signal some three to six months ahead of actual economic developments. Both indicators are produced by the Brazilian Institute of Economics at FGV (Ibre/FGV) in collaboration with the Swiss Economic Institute KOF at ETH Zurich. In the Global Coincident Barometer, the Asia, Pacific & Africa region contributed 1.2 points, while the Western Hemisphere had a positive impact of 0.2 points and Europe 0.4 points. ""All three regional indicators, in the 91-92 point range, suggest a level of global activity that is still below normal, in a gradual recovery, shaped by the various economic challenges faced by countries,"" noted FGV. In the Global Antecedent Barometer, the Asia, Pacific & Africa region contributed 0.3 points, while the Western Hemisphere had an impact of 0.5 points and Europe -0.2 points. ""The level of the indicators suggests a greater dissemination of the perception of an acceleration in the growth rate in the main regions over the coming months, with the indicators for Europe and the Western Hemisphere hovering around the neutrality of 100 points and the indicators for Asia, the Pacific & Africa assuming a more optimistic position,"" said FGV.

"2023_12";"Airlines still make little money post-Covid-19.txt";" Airlines probably retained on average just $5.44 (about R102) per passenger and have had a net profit margin of just 2.6% in 2023 despite a return to profitability by the industry in general after the knock it took during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). ""This net profit margin is far below what investors in almost any other industry would accept,"" Willie Walsh, IATAâ(EURO)(TM)s director-general, said at its Global Media Day in Geneva. That amount, he said, is not nearly enough to make the industry resilient in the wake of the pandemic, which cost it about four years of growth. ""From 2024 the outlook indicates that we can expect more normal growth patterns for both passenger and cargo."" Total air traffic is within 2% to 2.5% of its 2019 level, according to Andrew Matters, IATAâ(EURO)(TM)s director of policy and standards, sustainability and economics. ""We are just about there in terms of traffic. Given the share of fuel as part of airline costs, we are keeping a close eye on the oil and jet fuel market,"" Matters said in his presentation. IATA expects the jet fuel price to average $113.8 a barrel in 2024 â(EURO)"" a total fuel bill of about $281bn for the industry â(EURO)"" or 31% of airlinesâ(EURO)(TM) operating costs. IATA expects African airlines to show a combined net loss of about $500m this year and narrowing to about $400m next. Still, IATA said passenger demand on the continent was robust and is expected to increase about 7.3% in 2024 compared with 2023 levels. That would be 3% higher than before the pandemic struck in 2019. Airline capacity on the continent is expected to be 9.4% higher in 2024 compared with 2023 and also 3% more than before the pandemic in 2019. Africa remains a difficult market for airlines to operate in, with the biggest challenges being presented by economic situations, infrastructure and connectivity, IATA said. On a global level, airlines face challenges such as a crunch in the delivery of new aircraft â(EURO)"" which Walsh said is ""frustrating"". Airlines have also been affected by unforeseen maintenance issues on some aircraft or engine types and delays in the delivery of aircraft parts or of aircraft, limiting their capacity expansion and fleet renewal. As for ticket prices, IATAâ(EURO)(TM)s data shows competition continues to drive benefits for consumers. The average real return fare in 2023 is expected to have been about 20% lower than that of 2019, despite rising costs, especially that of fuel. 31% is the percentage of airline operating costs taken up by fuel $500m is this yearâ(EURO)(TM)s forecast net loss of African airlines t Page 2 of 2 Airlines still make little money post-Covid-19        "
"2023_12";"Commodity most exposed by Red Sea collapse_ one third of the world's jet fuel passes through this ro.txt";"  Continued attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi rebels, backed by Iran as part of the Gaza war, are beginning to disrupt world trade by jeopardizing transit through a key waterway. With the Suez Canal to the north and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait to the south, the Red Sea route is critical as the shortest sea link between Asia and the West. The world's major shipping lines and some energy companies have already ordered their shipments to be diverted to other longer and more costly routes. Many commodities and raw materials will be affected by this decision, but one is particularly exposed: jet fuel. More than 10% of the world's seaborne trade passes through the waters of the Red Sea. Of the two most important energy commodities, 12% of the world's seaborne oil and 8% of the world's gas are also shipped through this route, according to data from the US Department of Energy (EIA). In the case of jet fuel, the percentage passing through the Suez Canal exceeds 30%, according to figures from the international trade analysis house Kpler. One of the vessels that came close to being hit by missiles last week was the Marshall Islands-flagged Ardmore Encounter, loaded with jet fuel from Mangalore, India, In a quick analysis after the multiple attacks on ships at the end of last week, the experts of the renowned firm point out that aviation fuel is the most exposed cargo, far above other oil derivatives such as diesel or naphtha, with 15% of world transport being carried through the area, and also other cargoes such as grain and oilseeds -for oil extraction- (more than 10%), coal (around 7-8%) or iron ore (approximately 2-3%). Gasoline, also derived from crude oil, accounts for slightly less than 5%. ""European refineries, under pressure from new competition from emerging regions and with rationalization of their operations as the only option, were not producing sufficient volumes for the continent's demand. As a result, Europe has been a major importer of jet fuel, with large portions of its needs coming from producers east of the Suez,"" Fotios Katsoulas, senior trade and supply chain analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, explains in a note. Among the main suppliers of jet fuel to Europe, S&P Global cites the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and India, which before the pandemic already accounted for almost half of the volumes shipped to Europe. The drastic change in trade with Russia due to the war in Ukraine has made look even more to the East of the Red Sea. South Korea is also referred to as a major exporter. The fact that Europe has had to pull more from its Asian suppliers is coupled with this disruption in the way this trade was taking place, complicating the scenario. Monday's announcement by two big-name oil companies such as Britain's BP and Norway's Equinor that they are suspending scheduled shipments through the Red Sea sends a clear message: supplies will have to change routes, leading to more difficulties. At least five LNG tankers have changed course off the coast of Yemen since Friday. Some shipping lines such as Maersk on Tuesday have already pointed to the Cape of Good Hope route as the alternative. The U.S. and other Western partners have committed in recent hours to strengthen security in the area with the launch of Operation Prosperity Guardian, an expansion of the multinational maritime force present in the waters of the Persian Gulf in the face of the attacks carried out by the Houthis in recent weeks, given the apparent unwillingness to carry out bombings against the rebels in Yemen for the time being, given the risk of expansion of the conflict in the Middle East. However, this is not deterring the various operators from seeking safer routes for the time being. Opting to skirt all of Africa to its southern tip rather than cut through the Suez Canal means adding 40% to the travel distance, but safety is a premium. ""An Asia-Europe round trip via the Suez Canal takes about 10 weeks, compared to about 13 weeks via the Cape of Good Hope. This means that one week of significant capacity slippage could have ripple effects for several months after a few weeks' gap,"" explains the UBS shipping team led by Cristian Nedelcu in a client report. ""The potential implications for ocean freight rates and ocean carriers' profitability will depend on the length of the disruption. The longer duration of the Cape of Good Hope transit reduces the effective capacity of an Asia-Europe voyage by 25%. Importantly, much of the long-term Asia-Europe contracts are renegotiated in December (for Maersk) and January-March (for Hapag Lloyd), which may allow carriers to lock in higher rates than expected if disruptions persist,"" the UBS strategists add. According to Freightos.com, a booking and payment platform for international freight, the rate for that route through Suez on Sunday was $2,414 for a 40-foot container, up 62% since late November. Also, the London-based Joint War Committee, which provides risk advice to Lloyd's marine insurance underwriters, on Monday expanded the portion of the Red Sea it considers part of the world's riskiest waters. That means it will increase the length of time during which ships need war risk cover. The cost of such coverage has increased nearly 10-fold since the attacks began. If the BP and Equinor announcements resulted in rises of more than 3.5% in oil futures on Monday despite the bearish fundamentals in the crude oil market, the case of jet fuel deserves watching. Rising travel demand this winter is boosting jet fuel refinery margins in Asia, providing a bullish point for the oil market even as the outlook for other transportation fuels weakens. Post-pandemic air travel recovery accelerates in China and India, while record vacation travel demand is expected in the US. The travel boom also coincides with higher demand for kerosene-type fuels, including jet fuel, in winter. This drives up prices for jet oil, the most profitable for Asian refiners. The rise in jet fuel comes after years of efforts by airlines to restore flight capacity to pre-covid levels and brings some relief to the oil market, although traders are weighing the bearish outlook for demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently cut its consumption growth forecast for the final quarter of the year by nearly 400,000 barrels per day, against a weaker macroeconomic backdrop. ""Although jet fuel represents a fairly small share of total oil consumption, we suspect it will drive a large part of the 1.4 million barrels per day growth in crude oil demand that we forecast for this year. We think jet fuel demand could increase by 0.9 million barrels per day as international flight activity continues to grow in China and the rest of the world,"" Kieran Tompkins, commodities analyst at Capital Economics, forecast in a newsletter this summer. ""Growth in air transport activity in markets outside China is slowing, but, according to our estimates, could still add 0.5 million barrels per day to aviation fuel demand by 2023,"" he added. According to BloombergNEF estimates, Chinese jet fuel demand will rise to 860,000 barrels per day by the end of January 2024. This is the highest level since 2020 and an increase of nearly 27% from the same date in 2023, according to the data. The country's aviation recovery has accelerated amid the year-end vacation season, while travel restrictions were eased further last month for some foreign nationals. In India, flights during the festive season, as well as increased business travel, also helped lift the country's jet fuel demand above pre-pandemic levels in November, industry consultancy FGE exposes in a report. Jet fuel demand in Asia, excluding China, will grow by 150,000 barrels per day in 2024 and reach close to 2019 levels in the period, the firm adds. The so-called Singapore regrade swap - a key indicator of the cost-effectiveness of producing jet fuel versus diesel - reached the highest levels since 2018 in November, according to PVM Oil data. It is currently more than 50% above five-year seasonal averages, according to Bloomberg calculations. However, despite the recovery in aviation, the possibility of warmer-than-average temperatures this year could weigh on the use of kerosene, which is used for winter heating. JP Morgan analysts estimate that a milder winter could reduce seasonal kerosene consumption in the U.S., Europe and Japan by 500,000 to 700,000 barrels per day, denting the bullish rim in middle distillates. ""Global distillate demand will not collapse next year, and we continue to expect refining margins (crack spreads) to be well above pre-crisis averages. Looking ahead to 2024, we believe the contribution of distillates to global oil demand growth will approach 60% of the 1.1 million barrels per day we forecast, led mainly by jet fuel and, potentially, by a cyclical recovery in diesel demand in the second half of the year. Still, given that global trade growth remains subdued, a big rebound is unlikely in the next quarter or two,"" says Bank of America's (BofA) commodities team led by Francisco Blanch in its latest bulletin. ""The situation means higher shipping costs and some short-term delivery delays. All these costs will have a direct impact on consumers,"" says Henning Gloystein, director of research firm Eurasia Group.

"2023_12";"Global Economics - Global Barometers on the rise for the sixth month in a row - KOF.txt";"The Global Barometers recorded their sixth consecutive increase, ending the year at a higher level than 12 months ago. The results signal that the recovery in global growth is continuing, albeit at a slow pace. The Coincident Barometer remains below 100 points, while the Leading Barometer has already established itself at a level above neutral. The Coincident Global Economic Barometer rises 1.5 points in December to 91.8 points, while the Leading Barometer increases 3.3 points to 105.9 points, the highest level since September 2021 (108.5 pts.). In both cases, the Asia, Pacific & Africa region makes the largest contribution to the increase, while the other regions contribute much less. With the stronger rise in the Leading Barometer this month, the difference between the two Global Barometers is now 14.1 points, the largest since March 2021 (17.1 pts.) ""Despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions, the global economy is slowly emerging from its trough. The improvement in both the still below-average coincident barometer and the above-average leading indicator this month is due to data from Asia, the Pacific and Africa. As the gap between the two indicators has widened again, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the global economy. Although last year's frosty economic winter is still having an impact in many respects, the outlook has improved this time round"" comments Prof Jan-Egbert Sturm, Director of KOF Swiss Economic Institute, the latest results. Coincident Barometer - regions and sectors The increase in the Coincident indicator is mainly driven by the 1.3-point contribution of the Asia, Pacific & Africa region, while Europe contributes 0.2 points, and the Western Hemisphere remains constant. The regional indicators signal continued lukewarm global economic activity in gradual recovery, influenced by the various economic challenges faced by several countries. All the Coincident sector indicators evolve positively in December, except for the Services sector, which decreased this month. The Trade (retail and wholesale) indicator continues to progress favourably since July of this year, drawing away from the other sectors and reaching the neutral level of 100 points. Leading Barometer - regions and sectors The Leading Global Barometer leads the world economic growth rate cycle by three to six months on average. In December, the positive regional contributions come from the three regions, with the Asia, Pacific & Africa region standing out with 2.1 points, followed by the Western Hemisphere and Europe, with 0.7 and 0.5 points, respectively. The levels of the indicators suggest a more widespread outlook of acceleration in the growth rate in the main regions, with the indicators for Europe and the Western Hemisphere fluctuating around the neutral mark of 100 points and the indicator for the Asia, Pacific & Africa region taking a more optimistic stance. In December, all the Leading sector indicators increase except for Economy (aggregated business and consumer evaluations), which remained constant. The indicators for Services and Trade record their highest levels since the end of 2021, reflecting a positive outlook in relation to the coming months.

"2023_12";"Global economy faces rough weather ahead.txt";" Rising prices trigger protests as Fed's interest rate hikes cause spillover effects worldwide  US actors Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul met again in August. This time not for the reunion of the Breaking Bad series, but on the picket line in solidarity protests with other Hollywood actors.  Speaking to the crowd, Cranston said, ""We just want them to see reality and fairness and come back to the table and talk to us.""  Striking actors started the rally in mid-July, more than two months after screenwriters began protests in their bid to get better pay and working conditions under the influence of streaming services and artificial intelligence.  The celebrity-packed picket lines brought more attention to the so-called Hollywood double strike — writers and actors — unseen in 60 years.  From coast to coast, a wave of strikes has gripped the US throughout 2023, rippling across industries such as logistics and automobiles.  The country's United Auto Workers union began a strike in mid-September against all the Big Three automakers, namely Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis. The first-ever strike of all three at once in the union's 88-year history came after failed talks on new contracts.  In the past 50 years across the United States, there has been a massive redistribution of wealth, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said at a rally, highlighting the rising salaries of the CEOs of the Big Three automakers.  Against this backdrop, the union had reportedly been negotiating for significantly higher pay and new benefits.  ""After the pandemic, the US economy grappled with sluggish growth and encountered intense competition from other countries, presenting challenges for businesses,"" Wang Zhen, a research professor of international politics at the Institute of International Relations, Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told China Daily.  During the pandemic, the US implemented stimulus packages to bolster the economy.  ""The fiscal expansion policies led to high inflation and elevated the cost of living for the working class,"" Wang said. ""In addition, technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence, have encroached upon the traditional interests of corporate workers, prompting them to take to the streets to defend their rights.""  The US inflation rate started to grow at a more than 2 percent rate from March 2021 and peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022 to a 40-year high, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  To tame inflation, the US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark policy interest rate 11 times since March 2022 from the near-zero level to the current 5.25-5.50 percent range, marking the fastest pace in 40 years.  ""The Fed is as aggressive as it has been since the early 1980s,"" Chris Turner, global head of markets at the Dutch banking group ING, was quoted by CNN as saying.  ""They're willing to tolerate higher unemployment and a recession"", he said. ""That's not good for international growth.""  Even though inflation has eased from a peak of 9.1 percent last year, it remains too high for the Fed.  The US central bank said it remains ""highly attentive to inflation risks"" and that it is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent goal as it left interest rates unchanged on a Dec 13 meeting, a third pause from September.  The rate-setting group pointed to recent indicators showing that economic activity has slowed in the third quarter.  The high rates have put the banking system under pressure, which has seen the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March, and the failure of First Republic Bank in May. Elsewhere, UBS agreed in March to buy Credit Suisse in a rescue move to avert a banking sector meltdown.  ""Ripple effects of US financial system strains could lead to tighter credit, sharper slowdown worldwide,"" said a report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. ""Turmoil in the US banking sector isn't just a problem for the US. It also increases the risks of a global recession.""  Xu Gao, chief economist at Bank of China International, told China Daily, ""After the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank, the growth rate of credit extended to entities by the US banking system showed a slower pace.  ""Once the accumulated liquidity is drained, the impact of subsequent liquidity crunch is expected to manifest in the real economy.""  Citing the manufacturing purchasing managers index in the US which has run under 50 since November last year, Xu said, ""Although the US economy seems to be doing well this year, its role as a driving force for global economic growth has declined.""  The World Economic Outlook published by the International Monetary Fund in October said: ""Borrowing costs for emerging (markets) and developing economies remain high, constraining priority spending and raising the risk of debt distress.… The danger is of a sharp repricing of risk, especially for emerging markets, that would appreciate further the US dollar, trigger capital outflows, and increase borrowing costs and debt distress.""  In November, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told the European Parliament that although she expected the weakening of inflationary pressures to continue, ""the medium-term outlook for inflation remains surrounded by considerable uncertainty"". She said wages would continue to play a pivotal role in driving domestic inflation.  Daily squeeze on budgets  Tomas Hnyk, a Prague resident, told China Daily that ordinary people face a daily squeeze on their budgets.  ""The costs of energy and food and their basic services increased by a lot more than their income,"" he said.  Energy prices have surged, especially after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which cast a long shadow on the continent as no quick ending is seen, he said.  ""Prices went up for almost everything,"" he said. ""Despite inflation being smaller than it was, it is still a big issue. For people with less money, it is a huge deal.""  This frustration is not only felt in the Czech Republic, but also across other European countries, as they have experienced a wave of protests, with citizens demanding concrete steps from the government to ease their economic burden.  In France, people protested against an increase in the retirement age. In Germany, striking transportation workers caused major disruptions at airports and bus and train stations.  The United Kingdom also witnessed pay disputes across sectors, with workers demanding higher wages. Strikes in schools, railways and hospitals have become more frequent, notably in the National Health Service, where health workers staged the largest strike in its 75-year history. The financial strain intensified as Birmingham and Nottingham declared bankruptcy in September and November, respectively.  Meanwhile, Africa suffers from high inflation, as highlighted in the IMF Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa published in October, which said: ""Inflation is still too high. Inflation at end 2023 is projected to stay in double digits in 14 countries.""  In its Economic Outlook published in late November, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said it expected the global economy to slow down slightly in 2024 as a result of the tightening of monetary policy, weaker trade and dipping consumer confidence.  It projected a global GDP growth of 2.9 percent in 2023, followed by a mild slowdown to 2.7 percent in 2024 and a slight improvement to 3 percent in 2025. Asia is expected to continue to account for the bulk of global growth in 2024-25, as it has done this year.  Observers noted a recent trend of de-globalization, spearheaded by the US, resulting in disruptions to global supply chains.  The US and its Western allies ""have been the biggest beneficiaries ""of world economic integration and globalization since the end of the Cold War, Wang from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences said.  However, since former US president Donald Trump assumed office in 2017, a shift toward anti-globalization policies has been evident, initiating trade and technology wars aimed at curbing the ascent of developing countries, Wang said.  ""These policies, among others, failed to achieve the 'manufacturing reshoring' advocated by US policymakers, and have increased the operation costs for enterprises. This, in turn, burdens people across the globe, and poses a challenge to the world economic recovery after the pandemic.""  Leading to disruptions  The so-called decoupling or de-risking undeniably leads to disruptions to the global supply chains, said Xu from the Bank of China International. ""The potential hurdles and risks associated with this trend raise valid concerns about the overall stability and interconnectedness of the global economic landscape.""  Commenting on economic security, Pascal Lamy, former director-general of the World Trade Organization, said: ""You cannot do anything just by waving your flag of national security. This would destroy the multilateral trading system. So we have an issue which I think necessitates better attention.""  As the US monetary tightening cycle nears an end, there is a real risk of recession for the US whose economy stands at a ""precarious crossroads"", Xu said, pointing to challenges to global economic recovery.  ""Although overall if I look at these three engines — technology, ideology, and peace or geopolitical tensions or conflicts — I still believe that these engines will keep pushing for globalization,"" Lamy told a recent event hosted by the Center for China and Globalization.  2024 will be a pivotal year for elections worldwide, coupled with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Gaza crisis, which will add to uncertainties across the globe, Wang said.  Although headwinds abound, Wang remains cautiously optimistic about the potential growth.  ""It is still possible for the international community to maintain overall peace. After the pandemic, the willingness of countries around the world to strive for economic development has not waned, and the momentum of technological change has not stalled,"" he said.  ""Additionally, the negative repercussions of the Fed's rate hikes will be absorbed gradually, and it is widely anticipated that the Fed will pivot to monetary easing next year. These factors combined will bring new impetus and hope to the recovery of the world economy.""  Page 2 of 3 Global economy faces rough weather ahead        "

""We believe that the global economy next year will perform better than we feared some time ago,"" Georgieva said in a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. The global economy, she added, ""has proven remarkably resilient."" ""We have gone through unthinkable events: covid, then Russia's war in Ukraine, then the cost-of-living crisis, and now a very serious crisis in the Middle East. And yet we are not experiencing a dramatic economic shock."" Because of the pandemic, initial predictions were ""of depression,"" of ""a 10% or more contraction of the world economy, something that did not happen."" ""A contraction of 3.1% in relative terms is a demonstration of this resilience,"" explained the Fund's director. IMF downgrades global economic growth forecast for 2024 In its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) report published in October, the IMF lowered its forecast for global economic growth for 2024 by one tenth of a percent to 2.9% and maintained its forecast at 3% for this year. Georgieva noted that there are several things the Fund is concerned about today, the first, medium-term growth - ""we stay around this 3% year after year,"" she predicted. ""This is bad because when you look back before the pandemic, it was an average of 3.8%. So to lose almost a percentage point is quite dramatic over time,"" he explained. The IMF is also concerned about the ""very dangerous divergence"" that is occurring in the global economy with ""countries that are doing well"" and others that are doing not so well. ""As this divergence builds up, what we should fear is not only economic problems, but also security problems,"" Georgieva said. Therefore, she added, in a world with ""more frequent shocks,"" the only way to ""build resilience is to work more together,"" she said.

""The potential implications for ocean freight rates and ocean carriers' profitability will depend on the length of the disruption. The longer duration of the Cape of Good Hope transit reduces the effective capacity of an Asia-Europe voyage by 25%. Importantly, much of the long-term Asia-Europe contracts are renegotiated in December (for Maersk) and January-March (for Hapag Lloyd), which may allow carriers to lock in higher rates than expected if disruptions persist,"" the UBS strategists add. According to Freightos.com, an international freight booking and payment platform, the rate for that route through Suez on Sunday was $2,414 for a 40-foot container, up 62% since late November. Also, the London-based Joint War Committee, which advises Lloyd's marine insurance underwriters on risks, on Monday expanded the portion of the Red Sea it considers part of the world's riskiest waters. That means it will increase the length of time during which ships need war risk cover. The cost of such coverage has increased nearly 10-fold since the attacks began. If the BP and Equinor announcements resulted in rises of more than 3.5% in oil futures on Monday despite the bearish fundamentals in the crude oil market, the case of jet fuel deserves watching. Rising travel demand this winter is boosting jet fuel refinery margins in Asia, providing a bullish point for the oil market even as the outlook for other transportation fuels weakens. Post-pandemic air travel recovery accelerates in China and India, while record vacation travel demand is expected in the US. The travel boom also coincides with higher demand for kerosene-type fuels, including jet fuel, in winter. This drives up prices for jet oil, the most profitable for Asian refiners. The rise in jet fuel comes after years of efforts by airlines to restore flight capacity to pre-covid levels and brings some relief to the oil market, although traders are weighing the bearish outlook for demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently cut its consumption growth forecast for the final quarter of the year by nearly 400,000 barrels per day, against a weaker macroeconomic backdrop. ""Although jet fuel represents a fairly small share of total oil consumption, we suspect it will drive a large part of the 1.4 million barrels per day growth in crude oil demand that we forecast for this year. We think jet fuel demand could rise by 0.9 million barrels per day as international flight activity continues to grow in China and the rest of the world,"" Kieran Tompkins, commodities analyst at Capital Economics, forecast in a newsletter this summer. ""Growth in air transport activity in markets outside China is slowing, but, according to our estimates, could still add 0.5 million barrels per day to aviation fuel demand by 2023?, he added. According to Bloomberg's NEF estimates, Chinese jet fuel demand will rise to 860,000 barrels per day by the end of January 2024. This is the highest level since 2020 and an increase of nearly 27% from the same date in 2023, the data showed. The country's aviation recovery has accelerated amid the year-end vacation season, while travel restrictions were eased further last month for some foreign nationals. In India, flights during the festive season, as well as increased business travel, also helped lift the country's jet fuel demand above pre-pandemic levels in November, industry consultancy FGE exposes in a report. Jet fuel demand in Asia, excluding China, will grow by 150,000 barrels per day in 2024 and reach close to 2019 levels in the period, the firm adds. The so-called Singapore regrade swap - a key indicator of the cost-effectiveness of producing jet fuel versus diesel - reached the highest levels since 2018 in November, according to PVM Oil data. It is currently more than 50% above five-year seasonal averages, according to Bloomberg calculations. However, despite the recovery in aviation, the possibility of warmer-than-average temperatures this year could weigh on the use of kerosene, which is used for winter heating. JP Morgan analysts estimate that a milder winter could reduce seasonal kerosene consumption in the U.S., Europe and Japan by 500,000 to 700,000 barrels per day, denting the bullish rim in middle distillates. ""Global distillate demand will not collapse next year, and we continue to expect refining margins (crack spreads) to be well above pre-crisis averages. Looking ahead to 2024, we believe the contribution of distillates to global oil demand growth will approach 60% of the 1.1 million barrels per day we forecast, led mainly by jet fuel and, potentially, by a cyclical recovery in diesel demand in the second half of the year. Still, given that global trade growth remains subdued, a big rebound is unlikely in the next quarter or two,"" says Bank of America's (BofA) commodities team led by Francisco Blanch in its latest bulletin. ""The situation means higher shipping costs and some short-term delivery delays. All these costs will have a direct impact on consumers,"" says Henning Gloystein, director of research firm Eurasia Group.

Ltd, BP, Chevron, Corbion N.V, Exxon Mobil, Gazprom Neft PJSC, Honeywell International Inc., Primus Green Energy Inc., Qatar Jet Fuel, Royal Dutch Shell, Total Energies, and Valero Energy Corporation. Rapid industrialization, modernization and spread of information through internet led to the development of tourism industry which has fueled the jet fuel market opportunities. The increase in demand from military sector and rise in air transportation are expected to be major factors contributing to the market growth. New flight routes and new airports also surge the demand for fuel, which further drives the jet fuel market growth. Stringent rules regarding use of fuel variants and additives owing to high level of carbon emissions and fluctuations in crude oil prices are the factors that largely hamper the jet fuel market growth. Get a Customized Research Report: Biofuels that can significantly reduce carbon emissions and emerging sustainable jet fuel (SAF) that are under research & development offers lucrative opportunities for jet fuel industry growth. The alternate environment-friendly sources for jet fuel production are expected to greatly impact the jet fuel industry in the future. The jet fuel possesses better quality than fuels used in other modes of transportation. They are produced in different combinations of kerosene, kerosene-gasoline, kerosene-biofuel, and others. The fuels used in aviation reduce the risk of icing or explosion due to high temperature, which is obtained by incorporating some additives such as corrosion inhibitors and others. Jet fuel is primarily used by most of the military aircrafts and commercial airlines to maximize fuel efficiency and to lower the operational cost. Aircraft industry is expanding nowadays, which is increasing competition among aircraft jet fuel production in all sectors. Jet fuel is a type of aviation fuel that is designed for use in aircraft powered by gas-turbine engines. It is colorless to straw colored in appearance. It is most commonly used for commercial aviation are Jet A and Jet A-1, which are produced to a standardized international specification. As per global jet fuel market analysis, by fuel grade, the jet A fuel grade segment accounted for the largest share in 2021. General aviation application holds leading jet fuel market share in 2021. The shutdown of industrial manufacturers led to decline in the demand for solar related equipment in most of the countries across the world, which led to decline in demand for the jet fuel market.

"2023_12";"Jet Under Pressure as Oil Falls 10% on Lower Chinese Buying, Higher US Output.txt";" Faltering Chinese demand and booming non-Opec production, especially in the US, wiped more than 10% from oil prices. The worldâ€™s two largest economies are frustrating Opec-plus efforts to shore up the market. Closely-watched crude imports into China dropped below year-earlier levels for the first time since April last month, according to new official data. It comes as US crude production hit a new record of 13.2 million barrels per day in September, beating the previous high set in August.  International benchmark Brent lost $8.78 per barrel over the week to close at a more than five-month low of $74.05/bbl Dec. 7. US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate shed $6.62/bbl to finish the week at $69.43/bbl. Europeâ€™s low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures also suffered heavy losses with a surge in Russian ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) exports expected to boost global fuel supplies. A record 2 million metric tons (481,300 b/d) of Russian ULSD is expected to load at Primorsk alone in December, according to leaked loading schedules, up 21% from 1.6 million tons in November. Russia has pledged to keep 200,000 b/d of products off global markets as part of its Opec-plus commitments. But bloated domestic stocks mean refiners need to sell overseas. Heavy Russian diesel sales to Brazil are freeing up US Gulf Coast exports to come to Europe, while traffic to Africa means more Mideast Gulf diesel can also head through Suez. Gasoil tanks hit a five-week high of 1.77 million tons on Dec. 7, according to Insights Global. Jet is under pressure in Europe from flagging seasonal airline fuel demand. But logistical constraints are supporting the region's inland barge market. Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) barges were pegged at a $20 per ton premium to delivered cargoes at Thursday's close, compared to a $2.25/ton discount a week ago. Traders blamed a dearth of jet cargo imports into ARA where volumes are broken up, combined with Rhine shipping delays following recent flooding. ARA jet stocks hit a three-week low of 712,000 tons on Dec. 7, according to Insights Global, as tanker tracking showed most jet heading to the French port of Le Havre and UK terminals instead of Rotterdam. Cargoes were pegged at only a $42/ton premium to December ICE LSGO futures at Thursday's close, down from $70/ton last week. Barge differentials dipped only from $67.75/ton to $62/ton. The week saw just two jet cargo trades. European major BP sold two parcels of jet arriving in Rotterdam, but not until Dec. 27-31 to Swiss trader Vitol. Vitol paid a $69/ton premium to second-month January ICE LSGO futures in Wednesdayâ€™s window and January plus $65/ton Thursday. European air traffic is more than 10% below pre-pandemic levels for the time of year, according to network manager Eurocontrol. Aircraft fuel use is trailing even further behind. Nov. 30 saw the launch of border-free upper airspace between Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Eurocontrol says that will bring about significantly optimized routings, fuel savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The countries account for 35% of Europeâ€™s air traffic and are host to some of the regionâ€™s biggest airports. US jet fuel markets gave back their recent gains alongside the slide in oil prices. Weaker demand also contributed to price erosion, with sales dropping by 15% to 1.4 million b/d in the week ended Dec. 1. At the same time supply surged as refiners boosted utilization rates above 90% of capacity. Output climbed to nearly 1.8 million b/d, widening the gap between supply and demand. Much of the excess ended up in Gulf Coast inventories, which swelled by 1.4 million bbl to 21.1 million bbl. That left overall stocks at 38 million bbl at the start of Decemberâ€ on par with year-earlier levels. Strong refining margins are encouraging refiners to boost jet fuel yields to 10.9% of capacity. Crack spreads for jet reached $31.58 in the week ended Dec. 1, while low-sulfur diesel spreads sank to $30.35. Airlines are not seeing much relief from lower oil prices so long as crack spreads stay elevated. International Air Transport Association has flagged the wide margin between jet fuel and diesel as one of the key challenges facing aviation heading into 2024. Asian jet markets bucked the downward pressure and lurched upward, with benchmark Singapore spot price differentials rising to their highest level in two months at one point. Two deals done at strong levels in the Singapore trading window along with large arbitrage volumes pointed westwards bolstered the market. Singapore spot price differentials leapt to a $2.12/bbl premium to Singapore quotes on Dec. 4, the highest level since Oct. 2. They subsequently softened to a $1.88/bbl premium on Dec. 7, which still represented a $1.07/bbl jump from last week. A total of 200,000 bbl of late December to early January loading jet traded from Dec.1-7 in the Singapore Platts trading window. Gunvor sold 100,000 bbl loading in late December at a $2.30/bbl premium to Vitol on Dec. 4. Gunvor then sold another 100,000 bbl to Vitol loading in early January at a $1.90/bbl premium on Dec. 7. A total of 3.75 million bbl of arbitrage jet are loading from Dec. 6-31 from South Korea, India and China, according to Kpler. The volumes are pointed at the US, Europe and South Africa, with expected arrival dates ranging from Dec. 23-Jan. 23. Another 701,000 bbl of arbitrage jet are loading on Dec. 9 and 10 from Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, according to Kpler data. These volumes are heading to Europe and West of Suez in general and are due to arrive from Dec. 28-Jan. 17.

"2023_12";"KBC Bank - KBC Newsletter_ Economic Perspectives December 2023, Global economy.txt";"   Global economy The world economy weakens while inflationary pressures decline The world economy is showing important signs of weakening. This is most apparent in the US, where the impressive 1.3% third quarter growth is unlikely to be repeated in Q4. The resumption of student debt repayments along with tight monetary conditions and decreasing excess savings is poised to be a drag on consumption. In China, the real estate market is showing increasing signs of distress, weighing on consumer confidence, and is dragging economic growth down. Meanwhile, European growth continues to be sluggish with confidence indicators stabilising at relatively low levels pointing to continued near-term stagnation. The good news, however, is that inflation has been sliding downwards especially in the euro area (though base effects will likely cause a temporary rebound next month and inflation uncertainty is likely to increase going forward). This will allow central banks to stop the rate hiking cycle and allow them to start loosening monetary conditions earlier than expected. As the economy adapts further, we expect a gradual global recovery from the second half of 2024 onwards.

"2023_12";"Trends and challenges in the global economy.txt";"  As a consequence of the pandemic, several countries have lost presence in international markets. The increased cost of transporting goods and the limitations of mobility across borders have made small developing economies less resilient. At the recent meeting of the Trade and Development Board of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), the Trade and Development Report 2023, Preparing for the Future in the Face of Systemic Disruptions, was presented on current trends and challenges in the global economy. Since the World Growth Report was published last year, the global economy has slowed against a backdrop of decelerating prices. Patterns of recovery in different regions have varied considerably. In its introduction, the paper refers to the world economy flying at a loss-making speed, with projected growth in 2023 of 2.4 percent, meeting the conventional criteria for a global recession. The entire world economy, except East and Central Asia, has slowed since 2022, the paper says. But it warns that while there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon, celebrations of success would be inappropriate. The current global economic landscape is characterized by growing inequalities and diverging growth trajectories between key regions. The outlook for 2024 points to a modest improvement in growth (2.5%), contingent on the recovery of the euro area and the avoidance of adverse shocks from other leading economies. Without decisive action, the fragility of the global economy and a range of diverse shocks risk turning into systemic crises, so policymakers must navigate these challenges on multiple fronts to chart a stronger and more resilient path for the future. The report says that to avoid the potential crises of tomorrow, it calls for a policy mix that prioritizes reducing inequalities and achieving sustainable, investment-led growth and development. Among the recommendations it also says that concerted real wage increases and concrete commitments to comprehensive social protection should be allowed, and that investment in the energy transition process in developing countries should be actively promoted by making technology and financing available and affordable, thus requiring closer multilateral cooperation and appropriate arrangements in the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The analysis shows that worrying divergent recovery trends are emerging in 2023 in the context of slower growth in major regions and deepening income and wealth inequalities, in addition to growing debt pressures and declining policy autonomy in developing economies. In short, these factors are based on an increasingly complex interplay between economic, climate and geopolitical risks. Growing inequalities within countries are a source of weakness in global demand and continue to hold back investment and growth. The divergence of low growth trends between key regions, the paper notes, indicates that there is no clear driving force to propel the global economy onto a strong and sustainable recovery path.
