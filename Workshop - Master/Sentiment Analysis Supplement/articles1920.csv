"2019_1";"Challenges in store for global economytxt";" Stock market performance global debt levels and US monetary policy will all be key factors Ayear ago the Institute of World Economics and Politics made an estimate of 36 percent when forecasting the growth rate for 2018 slightly lower than the International Monetary Funds 37 percent And taken as a whole the global economy sustained a mediumrate growth over the last year but with a wide disparity among major economies Among the major developed economies the United States registered a growth rate of 29 percent in 2018 the European Union 21 percent and Japan 11 percent Of the major emerging economies Chinas growth rate was an estimated 66 percent in 2018 and India had a growth rate of 74 percent Russia 17 percent and Brazil 14 percent were lower than expected South Africa just managed to avoid a negative growth rate by growing by 06 percent In retrospect the world economy experienced a bit of a rollercoaster ride in 2018 Initially the accelerated growth in the latter half of 2017 and the first half of 2018 boosted optimism globally but the unilateral protectionist trade policy of the Trump administration created trade tensions and exerted a negative influence on the world economy on multiple fronts and the multilateral and regional trading systems have come to a stage of profound adjustments The aforementioned factors increase the recession risks for the world economy in 2019 Looking ahead the global economic trend this year will hinge on the following factors First the direction and pace of adjustment of US monetary policy The basic monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has returned to a neutral interest rate In theory against the context of full employment and stable low prices a neutral interest rate exerts neither stimulus nor a containing effect on economic growth As the US economy has improved the Fed has gradually changed its ultralow interest rate to a neutral increase The interest rate ticked up four times in 2018 adding up to a total of nine increases since this rate hike cycle began in December 2015 The Fed has forecast it will hike the median Federal funds rate to 31 percent by the end of 2019 indicating at least two more upticks this year As the worlds largest economy the US monetary policy and its adjustments will no doubt influence the global economy significantly Second is the stock market performance of major developed countries After a nearly 10year bull market the US stock market peaked in September 2018 far exceeding its accumulative nominal GDP growth over the same period Guided by the US super slack monetary policy the global stock market values in the corresponding period increased by US54 trillion also surpassing the global accumulative nominal GDP growth In the first 11 months of 2018 the MSCI index slumped by 57 percent As interest rate hikes by the Fed are expected further fluctuations in asset prices in the US and the world at large are highly probable  a 1015 percent adjustment in the US stock market will not be surprising Third is the global debt level The Institute of International Finance estimates that global debt topped US247 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 signifying aUS US75 trillion increase since the last quarter of 2008 Of this number corporate debt increased by US28 trillion Over the same period however the accumulative global GDP growth stood at US24 trillion The current global debt is three times the world GDP of 2017 hitting an alltime high Although the growth rate of global debt is slowing  in particular Chinas debt has started to decline  the size of global debt is still increasing Against the backdrop of a neutral monetary policy by the US a high debt level faces higher vulnerability susceptible to interest rate changes For example those developing countries and emerging markets which borrowed massive dollar debts when interest rates were very low have suffered major setbacks in their economies Fourth is the unilateral trade protectionism of the Trump administration Since conflicts among major economies continue to escalate the World Trade Organization twice lowered its estimates last year for the 2018 and 2019 global trade in goods In just one year prior to midOctober of 2018 WTO members introduced 137 items of trade protection measures covering US588 billion of imports seven times the amount in the previous year Although the overall effects of the protectionist measures are yet to be felt uncertainties in longterm trade policy will inevitably eclipse global trade and output The measures adopted by major developed countries such as higher tariffs stricter origin criteria and enhanced investment security scrutiny have already inhibited global investment Last but not least qualitative change has occurred in the economic and trade relations between China and the US The US government unveiled the Special 301 Report in 2018 and increased tariffs on Chinese goods which had a negative impact on ChinaUS trade Whether the two countries engage in cooperation or confrontation on issues such as WTO reform setting up more rigorous sustainable debt standards within the IMF and other multilateral and regional cooperation will have huge and farreaching influence on the global economy this year The IMF has lowered its global growth rate forecast for 2019 by 02 percentage points to 37 percent but the actual result might be 35 percent Besides the factors mentioned above the world economy is also facing several other challenges such as economic risks induced by major internet incidents market fluctuations caused by weaker expansion momentum and rebuilding confidence in the central banks of various countries In conclusion it is highly likely that the world will keep a medium growth rate of 35 percent in 2019 But if recessions are to occur in the US or Europe and spread to other countries this target will be hard to achieve The author is

"2019_1";"Chinese Tariffs Slowing Global Economytxt";"Just in time for the annual meeting of the high and the mighty at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland the International Monetary Fund IMF has issued the January update to its World Economic Outlook WEO To say that the outlook is muted may be an understatement For the year just passed the WEO has maintained its previous forecast of global growth at 37 but cautioned that a slowdown in the last half of the year will carry over into coming quarters with global growth for 2019 forecast at 35 and at 36 for 2020 both lower than the prior WEO estimate  Growth in advanced economies is projected to drop from 23 in 2018 to 20 in 2019 and 17 in 2020 primarily due to downward revisions in the eurozone Brexit remains a major concern and recent developments have done nothing to rein in uncertainty US growth in 2018 was revised downward to 23 and projected to dip to 25 in 2019 and dip further to 17 in 2020 as the unwinding of fiscal stimulus continues and the Federal Reserves funds rate temporarily overshoots the neutral rate of interest Ironically perhaps domestic US demand is expected to remain strong contributing to higher levels of imports and a wider US current account deficitEconomic growth in developing Asian countries ticks down to 65 in 2018 and is projected to dip to 63 in 2019 before recovering a bit to 64 in 2020 Trade tensions between China and the United States coupled with continued financial tightening in China are estimated to result in 66 economic growth in 2018 down from 69 in 2017 The WEO notes that worries about Chinas economy have and may again lead to selloffs in the financial and commodity markets that add pressure to the countrys trading partners commodity exporters and other emerging markets A key risk to the global economy going forward is tension over trade The tariff war between China and the United States is currently on hold but the WEO comments that the possibility of tensions resurfacing in the spring casts a shadow over global economic prospects Regarding commodities the WEO expects crude oil prices to remain broadly at around 55 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate WTI for the next four to five years A slowing global economy weakens demand for crude oil and uncertainty remains tied to supply increases and US policy on Iranian oil exports Inflation has been mostly restrained except in the United States where the WEO notes that abovetrend growth continues Among emerging economies lower oil prices are relaxing inflationary worries in most countries The principal risks to the global outlook are trade negotiations and financial conditions If trade issues are not resolved and more tariffs are imposed costs will rise on intermediate goods and ultimately for consumers Additionally uncertainty over trade issues lowers business investment disrupts supply chains and slows productivity growth Financial sentiment nosedived in the last few months of 2018 dragging equity prices down sharply The WEO noted other financial issues that could derail projections for growth in 2019 and 2020 interest rate spreads on Italian debt a nodeal Brexit and a deeperthanexpected slowdown in China The WEO suggests that policy priorities need to focus on preventing additional deceleration and strengthening resilience To that end addressing dissatisfaction with the worlds rulesbased trading system need to be addressed cooperatively in an effort to reduce trade costs and resolve differences without imposing tariffs On the domestic front developed nations are encouraged to emphasize policies that boost productivity raise labor force participation particularly of women and ensure adequate social insurance including for those vulnerable to structural transformation Emerging economies face a wider range of problems largely because they dont have much room for error High private debt burdens along with balance sheet and bond maturity mismatches need to be sorted out Fiscal policy should ensure that debt ratios remain sustainable under increasingly difficult external financial conditions Targeted subsidies and recurring expenses should help preserve capital outlays needed to boost potential growth and social spending to enhance inclusion ALSO READ The Fastest Growing and ShrinkingStates 1 The following table offers an overview of WEO global growth projections along with additional projections on trade volume commodity prices consumer prices and the Libor rate  1 https247wallstcomspecialreport20190118thefastestgrowingandshrinkingstates3   LoadDate January 22 2019   End of Document"

Administration data East Coast stocks plunged by 700000 bbl to 84 million bbl amid a dearth of imports and were 20 below the yearearlier mark Deliveries soared to more than 18 million bbl as airlines and suppliers replenished tank levels following the busy yearend holiday period Imports also surged to 223000 bd but mainly landed at West Coast ports Strong export flows out of the Gulf Coast to Latin America and the Caribbean are keeping trade flows balanced The slow pace of deliveries in the last weeks of 2018 have clipped the wings of US demand growth to just 11 for the calendar year down

90bbl to Singapore quotes on a Taiwan fob basis The refiner had originally offered two 300000 bbl cargoes  one loading Feb 15 and the other loading Feb 1115 South Korean refiners could be looking to offer February loading spot jet at discounts of around 50bbl to Singapore quotes on a Korea fob basis Asian demand remains soft due to a relatively mild winter so far in large swaths of Northeast Asia Temperatures in much of Japan are likely to remain warmer than usual from now through Feb 11 according to the Japan Meteorological Agency Jet kerosene demand is much softer than last year which experienced an unusually cold winter On the supply side this year jet inventories remain ample while Chinas exports are more than sufficient as the government allocates generous export quotas for refiners to alleviate a domestic surplus Asian refiners are benefiting from low jet fuel prices which help induce cargo flows out of the region to higherpriced markets in the US and Europe But at the moment the arbitrage windows to Europe and the US appear breakeven for most market players Looking ahead jet kerosene demand should pick up due to increased air travel around the Lunar New Year festival celebrated in early February in China Taiwan South Korea Vietnam and Singapore  "

experience a boost in 2019 as a result of increased investments and regulatory reforms Photo  Reuters file for illustrative purpose Although global economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019 amid the challenges resulting from a decline in trade and industry structural reforms by governments in the GCC region designed to protect their economies from global volatility are well on track to achieving their objectives  underscored by a focus on the nonoil sectors  Notably although the outlook set by the World Banks Global Economic Prospects report anticipates GCC growth to average 26 per cent in 2019 below the global average of 29 per cent this projected growth for the region is higher than in 2018 when it did not exceed 2 per cent   The rise in oil production and prices in 2018 played a pivotal role in easing the pressures of policies that aimed to regulate general fiscal conditions after several countries in the GCC region rationalized public spending The surge in oil revenues contributed to an increase in current account balances which in turn enabled an increase in public spending   While recognizing the importance of oil recovery in raising the growth rates of the regional economy we cannot ignore the impact of economic diversification policies over the past four years Diversifying away from oil has led to the emergence of mega projects aimed at maximizing nonoil revenues in sectors that have been overlooked for years such as technology tourism and financial services among others   According to the World Bank economic growth in the GCC region is likely to experience a boost in 2019 as a result of increased investments and regulatory reforms This confirms that 2018 brought about significant changes and enabled some of the regional economies such as Oman and Saudi Arabia to overcome their deflation in 2017 Both countries recorded negative economic growth of 09 per cent in 2017 while the rate of decline was more severe in Kuwait 35 per cent according to the World Bank   We can easily link the progress made by countries in the GCC region with their plans to overcome oil fluctuations and their shift in focus towards nonoil sectors Such efforts will help achieve an economic growth rate over the next three years that can reach or exceed the expected growth average of the global economy For example the World Bank forecasts that Oman will grow by 34 per cent by end2019 which is above the expected average growth rate for both the regional economy and the global economy However this growth is expected to slow down in 2020 and 2021 to 28 per cent The World Bank expects the UAE economy to grow from 2 per cent in 2018 to 3 per cent in 2019 and 32 per cent in 2020 and 2021   As for the Saudi economy which is the largest in the GCC and the wider Arab region the World Bank expects growth over the next three years to continue rising from 2 per cent in 2018 to 21 per cent in 2019 and 22 per cent in the following two years  The same is true for Bahrains economy  28 per cent until 2021  as well as the Qatari economy which is set to surge from a 23 per cent growth rate in 2018 to 27 per cent in 2019 and as much as 3 per cent in 2020 and 2021   These promising growth expectations for the economies of the GCC region are the direct outcome of the strategic plans adopted to diversify economic activities and develop new nontraditional sectors in these countries There is a remarkable acceleration in implementing these plans not only in terms of mega projects in all countries but also in terms of creating the legislative structure and enabling investment environment for a new phase of sustainable growth independent of oil price fluctuations   Starting early in 2019 initiatives are being launched in the GCC countries to enhance the attractiveness of their legislative and investment environments For instance Bahrain has become the first country in the world to enact a legislation that supports the circulation of electronic documents in line with the UNCITRAL Model Law The move aims to strengthen Bahrains legislative structure and increase the attractiveness of the Bahraini economy to foreign investors As part of a series of comprehensive legislative reforms the law will spur the growth of the digital economy in the GCC markets that is valued at US15 trillion   His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai launched the Eight Principles of Dubai in early 2019 The sixth principle states Economic diversification has been the foundation of our unwritten constitution in Dubai since 1833 The changing times and the rapid developments make our commitment to this principle everlasting Our new goal is to create at least a new economic sector every three years that will be productive contribute to our GDP and generate jobs   The same efforts are true of the wider GCC region where nations are racing to implement their ambitious development plans including the Saudi Vision 2030 the UAE Vision 2021 Bahrain Economic Vision 2030 Qatar National Vision 2030 the Kuwait Vision 2035 and Oman Vision 2040 Given the tremendous achievements that the countries in the region have already posted I believe the GCC economy is going in the right direction However as with all creditable efforts more emphasis is needed to consolidate the new trends on the road to sustainable growth   "

"2019_3";"Weaker global economy slows exportstxt";" Bern The Federal Council has issued the following press release Economic forecasts by the Federal Governments Expert Group  spring 2019 The Expert Group is lowering its forecast for GDP growth in 2019 from 15 to 11 The global economy is losing more momentum than previously assumed which is slowing down Swiss foreign trade and investment activity Economic growth is set to rise to 17 in 2020 In the second half of 2018 Switzerlands economy cooled off significantly The global economy and world trade lost momentum which also curbed Swiss foreign trade while domestic demand failed to stimulate growth Investment activity in particular weakened considerably The Expert Group expects both the domestic and the international economy to regain momentum only gradually in 2019 In particular the outlook in other European countries has recently become much gloomier and growth forecasts for major trade partner Germany have been revised significantly downwards As a result international demand for Swiss products is weaker and the export economy is losing momentum In the wake of a subdued development of orders coupled with considerable uncertainty companies in Switzerland will hesitate to invest in production capacity in the next few quarters too Low growth is also to be expected with regard to investment in construction as vacancy rates are increasing and real estate prices are tending to decline The economic slowdown is also having an impact on the labour market Average unemployment for 2019 is still low at 24 but employment growth is easing and wage growth remains weak Private consumption is therefore seeing belowaverage development although the declining inflation annual inflation for 2019 04 is bolstering households real purchasing power Overall the Expert Group is lowering its forecast for GDP growth in 2019 significantly from 15 December 2018 forecast to 11 The global economy is expected to gain moderate momentum in 2020 Provided that the international trade dispute does not intensify further global trade will also pick up again This will support Switzerlands export economy At the same time domestic growth forces will gain in importance In particular the willingness to invest is anticipated to increase considerably again and private consumption is set to grow somewhat faster in the wake of stronger employment growth and rising real income The Expert Group is therefore forecasting higher GDP growth of 17 for 2020 December 2018 forecast 17 with annual inflation of 06 The current economic slowdown is likely to have a delayed impact on the unemployment rate with the Expert Group expecting an increase to an annual average of 26 in the next year Economic risksDownside risks continue to predominate for the global economy If the trade dispute between the US and other major economic areas were to intensify further the global economy and world trade would cool off more strongly than assumed in this forecast This would slow down both Swiss foreign trade and the investment activity of companies Switzerland would be particularly affected if the conflict between the US and the EU were to escalate and for example substantial tariffs on German cars were to be introduced Conversely the domestic and the foreign economy could pick up again more strongly in case of an agreement on major aspects of the trade dispute Political uncertainty remains high in Europe In particular it is unclear whether Brexit will come into force in late March 2019 and what the relationship between the EU and the UK will look like then Moreover Italys economic and financial situation harbours more substantial risks again following the countrys slide into recession The relationship between Switzerland and the EU is still clouded by a certain degree of uncertainty for example in connection with the framework agreement and the corporate tax reform Should relations with the EU deteriorate significantly companies investment activity could suffer In view of simmering imbalances the risk of a major correction in the Swiss real estate sector also remains Conversely there is the possibility that Switzerlands domestic economy will pick up again more strongly also in view of the good situation on the labour market and will at least partially offset the weak development in the second half of 2018 "

"2019_4";"Global economy enters synchronised slowdowntxt";" The global economy has entered a synchronised slowdown which may be difficult to reverse in 2019 according to the latest update of a  tracking index compiled by the Brookings Institution thinktank and the Financial Times  Sentiment indicators and economic data across advanced and emerging economies have been deteriorating since last autumn suggesting fading momentum in global growth and the need to resort to new forms of economic stimulus  The worsening outlook has sparked warnings from Christine Lagarde managing director of the IMF who said the fund would cut its growth forecasts later this week and the World Trade Organization which has said the continued threats of trade skirmishes had weakened forecasts  The findings follow generally disappointing economic indicators over the past six months that have shown a similar picture in the US China and in Europe  Professor Eswar Prasad of the Brookings Institution said the slowdown did not yet appear to be heading for a global recession but all parts of the world economy were losing momentum  The nature of the slowdown has ominous portents for these economies over the next few years especially given present constraints on macroeconomic policies that could stimulate growth he said  The BrookingsFT Tracking Index for the Global Economic Recovery Tiger compares indicators of real activity financial markets and investor confidence with their historical averages for the global economy and for individual countries The headline readings slipped back significantly at the end of last year and are at their lowest levels for both advanced and emerging economies since 2016 the year of the weakest global economic performance since the financial crisis The index fell partly because hard data indicating real economic activity has been weaker with countries such as Italy falling into recession and Germany narrowly avoiding one and with the US economy losing steam as the effects of Donald Trumps tax cuts wear off  Although economic sentiment remains high in advanced economies it has fallen from its peaks and has plummeted to well below normal levels in emerging economies led by fears that Chinas years of rapid economic growth are coming to an end  Athough Chinas economy has been showing signs of improvement following government efforts to stimulate capital spending and the US Federal Reserves reversal of its plans for further interest rate rises this year has had a steadying effect economic confidence has taken a knock over the past six months  Growth indicators in Europe have been disappointing Prof Prasad said Globally only India stands out as an exception to the slowing trend boosted by fiscal and monetary stimulus ahead of national elections starting later this month  Delays in the anticipated trade rapprochement between the US and China have also raised questions over the prospects for greater momentum in the world economy in the second half of the year  Trade tensions and the uncertainty they have spawned are likely to leave a longlasting scar on the world economy This uncertainty is undermining business confidence and depressing private investment which has implications for longerterm productivity growth Prof Prasad said He added that any weakness might be amplified by policymakers inability to provide effective stimulus to boost prospects later this year  High levels of public debt are likely to limit the ability of major advanced economies to counteract a slowdown with fiscal stimulus he said Conventional monetary policy remains constrained in many advanced economies where policy rates are close to or below zero while any further unconventional monetary policy actions present significant risks and uncertain payoffs "

"2019_4";"The Global Economy A Delicate Momenttxt";" WashingtonDC   US  International Monetary Fund has issued the following news release  A year ago economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world One year later much has changed The escalation of USChina trade tensions needed credit tightening in China macroeconomic stress in Argentina and Turkey disruptions to the auto sector in Germany and financial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018  With this weakness expected to persist into the first half of 2019 our new World Economic Outlook WEO projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy Global growth softened to 36 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 33 percent in 2019 The downward revision in growth of 02 percentage points for 2019 from the January projection is also broad based  It reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area Latin America the United States the United Kingdom Canada and Australia  After the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 This pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential The US Federal Reserve the European Central Bank the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have all shifted to a more accommodative stance China has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs Furthermore the outlook for USChina trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape  These policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries Emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the US dollar While the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to materialize Measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover  With improved prospects for the second half of 2019 global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 36 percent This recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies where growth is projected to increase from 44 percent in 2019 to 48 percent in 2020 Specifically it relies on an expected rebound in growth in Argentina and Turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty Growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020 despite a partial recovery in the euro area as the impact of US fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group given aging trends and low productivity growth  Beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilize at around 3 percent bolstered mainly by growth in China and India and their increasing weights in world income Growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent though with considerable variance as emerging Asia continues to grow faster than other regions A similar pattern holds for lowincome countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms  Risks to global growth  While the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks Tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains Growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and China may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding Brexit remain heightened A deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereignbank doom loop risks  Given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided Policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesnt weaken investment Fiscal policy will need to manage tradeoffs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on countryspecific circumstances Financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as countercyclical capital buffersa task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer Monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored  Across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience There is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation  This is a delicate moment for the global economy If the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound If however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies exportdependent economies and highlyindebted economies may be derailed In that case policymakers will need to adjust Depending on circumstances this may require synchronized though countryspecific fiscal stimulus across economies complemented by accommodative monetary policy Lastly adequate resources for

"2019_5";"Global Aviation Fuel Market 2019 Trends Market Share Industry Size Opportunities Analysis and Fotxt";" Summary A new market study titled Discover Global Aviation Fuel Market Upcoming Trends Growth Drivers and Challenges has been featured on WiseGuyReports  Introduction  Global Aviation fuel Market Overview  Aviation fuel is a specialized type of petroleumfuel used to power aircraft It is generally of a higher quality than fuels used in less critical applications such as heating or road transport and often contains additives to reduce the risk of icing or explosion due to high temperature among other properties  Aviation market is emerging as one of the fastest growing sectors due to the rapid increase in the global middleclass families this growth which is mainly coming from the developing countries as well as increasing penetration of lowcost carriers among these nations The Global Aviation Fuel Market was worth USD XX Billion in 2018 and is expected to reach XX USD Billion by 2026 at a CAGR of X during the forecast period 2019 2026  As per the study of International Air Transport Association IATA there are around 78 billion passengers who are expected to be traveling by 2036 which is almost double the number in 2017  In this growing sector AsiaPacific has emerged as one of the largest aviation fuel markets in recent years Developing countries such as China India and Indonesia are expected to be the fastest growing markets regarding additional annual passengers by 2036  Get Free Sample Report at httpswwwwiseguyreportscomsamplerequest3791880globalaviationfuelmarket20192026  Market Dynamics  Aviation fuel market has seen a considerable increase in passenger air travel globally In the last six years the aviation industry has witnessed with a rise in more than 6 global air passenger travel demand This increase in air travel passengers has a major contributing factor ie increase in the global middleclass population majorly in the Asia Pacific developing countries like China India Indonesia will lead to increase in the consumption of more Aviation fuel supporting the growth of the Aviation fuel market  The growing demand of global passenger travel demand is also a result of the rise in urbanization and disposable income in these developing countries as the majority of the workforce in these countries are young and working class There are significant demographic and social changes happenings in these regions which are also contributing to an increase in demand for the aviation market  The entire region also lacks in having an efficient transportation system which is another factor leading people in these countries to prefer towards traveling through planes saving on time  The prices of crude oil which are the main factor determining the cost of the aviation fuel has drastically come down after being shaken with a decline in the price of crude oil coming up to USD27 in the starting of 2016 at a time Price of crude oil still plunging to around USD60 and rising income of the middle class is aggressively motivating many low budget carriers companies to serve the passengers well This growth can again slump as the prices of the crude oil rise over the coming years  Few other factors which can also hamper this growth pertain to Global government strict environment policies in reducing carbon footprint through airways  Market Segmentation  Aviation fuel can be segmented by the type of fuel and type of application use  Based on the type of aviation fuel it is categorized as Jet fuel A A1 and Jet B and Biofuel Where Jet Fuel A1 is the standard fuel with commonly used all over the world Jet A is the fuel type which is usually used in the United States and major airports in Canada Jet Fuel B is the fuel with Napthakerosene in it and is mostly used in cold countries It is an alternative fuel to Jet A1 as Jet A1 is difficult to handle high flammable conditions  Increasing airline companies are using alternative fuels such as bio fuel to cope with environmental concerns For instance In August 2018 Spicejet Airline Company took off from Dehradun to New Delhi propelled with the mixture of BioDiesel and Aviation fuel  Based on the application type the aviation fuel is categorized as commercial defense and others Commercial aircraft hold the major share XX in the consumption of aviation fuel due to large mobility of passengers traveling worldwide Defense aircrafts and others hold next highest share XX in the consumption of Aviation fuel as they are governed and owned by various federal state governments and Private companies of each country  Based on the geographical regions Asia Pacific region holds the maximum share of XX air travel passenger demand due to major developing economies which are increasingly urbanizing leading to strong demand for Aviation fuel market growth It was followed by Europe with XX where the significant countries are well developed and the air transport infrastructure is well established driving the continuous demand for the Aviation Fuel Market in the recent years  Competitive Analysis  Major aviation fuel companies in the world have gone through a rough phase as prices of oil fluctuated very much the prices of the fuel showed a continuous increase which led to the intense competition between different low budget carriers  premium carrier airlines  Industry players are developing new fuel technologies in the Aviation fuel market For instance In November 2018 Japans biotechnology company Euglena started mass production of the bio jet fuel and biodiesel derived from algae and waste oil being the first company to fuel green commercial flights out of Japan  Trends in the Market  Although with the low oil prices which have been a significant contributor to recent growth in air transportation the amount of the fuel is only part of the picture With aviation fuel costs running at around a third of overall airline costs passing on the lower oil prices to the customers in the form of lower ticket costs have certainly contributed to the strong performance  NonOECD markets are also following a similar path for example China has been undergoing progressive liberalization since the early 2000s lifting price caps on domestic flights in 2018 while India deregulated since 1994 continues to work on openness the country now has the largest LCC Lowcost carrier sector seconded by Indonesia with China running third  In recent years emissions norms being strict for airlines operating companies which have shown interest towards alternative jet fuel which was trending majorly in developed economies like US and European countries where they tried using bio jet fuel last year replacing conventional ones  New Infrastructure developments leading to better connectivity in the air travel sector in the developing nations like China  India and Indonesia which led to increase in the air travel passengers in turn driving the demand for Aviation fuel "

wwwreportaldatacom  Latest Research LNG import quotas in Lithuania  Economic effects of breaking Gazproms natural gas monopoly Simon Schulte and Florian Weiser Abstract Until 2014 Russias Gazprom had a natural gas monopoly in Lithuania In order to break the Russian monopoly the Lithuanian state financed an import terminal for liquefied natural gas LNG in Klaipėda In addition to building the terminal Lithuania signed a longterm contract LTC which can be interpreted as a minimum import volume quota for LNG having higher marginal supply costs than Russian gas This study assesses the potential of such a minimum import volume quota to mitigate the market power of a monopolistic supplier A market consisting of a dominant supplier with low marginal supply costs and a competitive fringe with high marginal supply costs is analyzed It is shown that there is a minimum import volume quota for fringe supplies that optimizes the consumer surplus which is adjusted by a compensation paid for the fringes market entry Therefore the Lithuanian decision to incentivize the market entry of highcost LNG can be rationalized httpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiiS0140988318304328 The

financial statements for the threemonth period ended 31 March 2019 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS Financial Highlights   Sales In the first quarter of 2019 our sales amounted to RUB 18509 bln which is 135 higher yearonyear mainly due to weaker ruble and higher volumes of oil and gas sales outside Russia driven by higher production volumes along with increase in crude oil trading volumes The sales dynamics has been restrained by lower hydrocarbon prices in US dollar terms along with lower volumes of refined products wholesale sales outside Russia mostly owing to reduction in trading volumes Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 our sales decreased by 94 mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices and reduction in crude oil and refined products trading volumes EBITDA Despite lower sales our EBITDA in the first quarter of 2019 amounted to RUB 2981 bln up 358 yearonyear and 71 quarteronquarter Compared to both periods EBITDA dynamics benefited from higher gas production volumes outside Russia bigger share of highmargin barrels in the total crude oil production in Russia lower lifting costs per barrel positive crude oil export duty lag effect adoption of the tax on additional income from hydrocarbon production for certain license areas positive inventory effect in the refining segment as well as increase in retail margins The yearonyear EBITDA growth was also supported by weaker ruble and higher refinery throughput volumes EBITDA growth was constrained by lower international hydrocarbon prices external limitations on oil production in Russia as well as lower refining margins in Russia and Europe Profit for the period Profit attributable to shareholders totaled RUB 1492 bln up 368 yearonyear The growth was restrained with higher DDA due to the launch of new production facilities Despite higher EBITDA the profit declined quarteronquarter by 62 mainly due to higher DDA following its reduction in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by oneoff upward revision of the proved developed reserves Capital expenditures In the first quarter of 2019 capital expenditures were RUB 974 bln which is 140 lower quarteronquarter and 195 lower yearonyear mainly due to the payment schedule to suppliers and contractors as well as external limitations on oil production in Russia Free cash flow In the first quarter of 2019 our free cash flow before changes in working capital amounted to RUB 1833 bln up 955 yearonyear and 328 quarteronquarter The growth was attributable to higher operating cash flow before changes in working capital and lower capital expenditures Higher working capital in the first quarter of 2019 was due to refined products inventory buildup within international trading business as well as increase in crude oil inventories at our refineries outside Russia IFRS 16 The adoption of the IFRS 16 Leases as of January 1 2019 led to an increase in our total debt by RUB 1496 bln The positive effect on EBITDA totaled RUB 87 bln due to lower operating transportation and SGA expenses The positive effect on free cash flow reached RUB 116 bln owing to an increase in operating cash flow and reduction in capital expenditures The positive effect on profit for the period amounted to RUB 42 bln due to foreign exchange gain on additional debt Operational highlights  In the first quarter of 2019 LUKOIL Groups average hydrocarbon production excluding the West Qurna2 project reached 2379 thousand boe per day which is 41 higher yearonyear and 03 higher quarteronquarter The increase was mainly driven by the development of international gas projects Liquid hydrocarbons Liquid hydrocarbon production excluding the West Qurna2 project in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 1792 thousand barrels per day which is 16 higher yearonyear and 05 lower quarteronquarter LUKOIL Groups oil production volumes and dynamics are mainly defined by the external limitations of the production volumes in Russia The active development of the priority projects continued In particular in the first quarter of 2019 oil production at the V Filanovsky field increased by 18 yearonyear The seventh well was commissioned at the second production platform of the field In the first quarter of 2019 oil production at the Yu Korchagin field increased by 27 yearonyear as a result of drilling program at the fields second development stage The development of the Yaregskoye field and Permian reservoir of the Usinskoye field including the launch of new steamgenerating capacities allowed increasing high viscous oil production in the first quarter of 2019 by 16 yearonyear to 12 million tonnes The development of growth projects in West Siberia also continued Overall oil and gas condensate production at the V Vinogradov Imilorskoye and Pyakyakhinskoye fields increased in the first quarter of 2019 by 14 yearonyear The share of the abovementioned projects in the LUKOIL Groups oil production excluding the West Qurna2 project amounted to 18 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the 15 in the first quarter of 2018 Gas In the first quarter of 2019 LUKOIL Groups gas production amounted to 90 billion cubic meters which is 12 higher yearonyear The main driver of gas production growth was the development of projects in Uzbekistan As a result of the launch of the second stage at Kandym gas processing plant production in Uzbekistan in the first quarter of 2019 increased to 38 billion cubic meters LUKOILs share which is 33 higher yearonyear The production growth was also supported by the launch of the second stage of Shah Deniz project in Azerbaijan in 2018 Refined products In the first quarter of 2019 LUKOIL Group produced 157 million tons of refined products at own refineries which is 43 higher yearonyear mainly driven by higher utilization rates at refineries in Nizhny Novgorod Perm as well as in Bulgaria and Italy Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the production of refined products decreased by 34 mainly owing to reduction in refining volumes at the European refineries because of feedstock supply interruptions from Novorossiysk Sea Port on the back of bad weather conditions Russian refineries increased production of refined products by 33 yearonyear to 104 million tons We continued to reduce production of fuel oil bringing its yield to 106 which is 13 p p

shutdown as well as the accumulation of alcohol reserves prior to the launch of DOTP production in Perm Sales volumes of elastomers increased by 96 to 136 thousand tonnes mainly due to an increase in the volume of longterm contracts with tire companies Financial results 		For the first three months of 2019 revenue increased by 90 yearonyear to RUB 131 billion with the following dynamics across segments 		Olefins  Polyolefins revenue increased by 41 to RUB 237 billion mainly due to positive price dynamics in Ruble terms for products in the segment due to the depreciation of the Ruble In turn this growth was offset by a slight decrease in revenue from sales of polyethylene due to a decrease in sales volumes 		Plastics Elastomers  Intermediates revenue increased by 51 to RUB 382 billion largely due to positive price dynamics in Ruble terms for most products and higher sales volumes of elastomers 		Revenue from the Midstream segment increased by 182 to RUB 592 billion due to growth in sales volumes of LPG and naphtha as well as positive price dynamics for LPG in Ruble terms due to the depreciation of the Ruble compared to the same period in 2018 EBITDA increased by 45 to RUB 442 billion as a result of a 58 increase in EBITDA in the Olefins  Polyolefins segment and a 72 increase in Midstream segment due to positive dynamics in selling prices This was partially offset by a decrease in EBITDA in the Plastics Elastomers  Intermediates segment due to a shortterm increase in the share of raw materials purchased from third parties during a planned shutdown of terephthalic acid production while upgrading and capacity expansion works were carried out in Blagoveshchensk At 337 there was little change in EBITDA margin compared to the first quarter of 2018 Net profit increased by 715 to RUB 460 billion mainly due to the revaluation of debts denominated in foreign currency Borrowings As of 31 March 2019 total debt amounted to RUB 3499 billion an increase of 53 compared to 31 December 2018 The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of lease obligations due to the Groups adoption of IFRS 16 since 1 January 2019 as well as an increase in conventional debt and new drawdowns of ZapSibrelated financing The increase was partially compensated by the currency revaluation of the credit portfolio due to the appreciation of the Ruble during the quarter Net debt5 as of 31 March 2019 increased by 50 compared with 31 December 2018 to RUB 3335 billion The net debt to EBITDA ratio was 16x as of 31 March 2019

under threat from the expanding USChina trade war However are we to believe the frightening headlines predicting that a global recession is imminent Should investors start selling their equities with

history at over 120 months we are due for a recession But economic cycles dont have schedules They dont happen in a routine way so the length of a recovery should not be a predictor of the next downturn As we have seen recently central banks have quickly reacted to add more monetary stimulus in order to protect the recovery and extend it Rather we should at least interrogate what the classical cyclical indicators are signalling If we look at four of these indicators which historically have warned of an overheating economy and therefore a coming recession in the US none is flashing red In fact three are green and only one is amber when we compare this expansion with the previous seven recoveries dating back to 1961 First we note that while US GDP growth has been consistently positive over the past 10 years it has not approached levels that suggest overheating or reached the 47 yearonyear rates seen in previous recoveries Indeed US GDP growth has been decidedly lacklustre typically 13 year on year  the most pedestrian recovery since World War 2 There has not been a buildup of excess consumer demand that would push prices up and give the Fed a reason to hike interest rates significantly and put an end to the expansion This is the first green indicator Following from this is the complete lack of inflationary pressure in the current recovery Averaging less than 2 year on year US inflation has been lower than during any recovery since World War 2 In the past prices have typically risen inexorably in the latter part of a recovery cycle but at present the absence of price pressures is puzzling for economists This is the second green indicator The third cyclical recession indicator is unemployment In the current recovery the US unemployment rate has fallen from 10 to 36 a 50year low and matching the best level reached in any previous recovery This is a classic warning sign of approaching labour market overheating and so is flashing amber However this very low unemployment rate has not fed through into higher wages in any significant way Though US wage growth has averaged 253 year on year over the past seven years it started extraordinarily low and rose only very slowly remaining at the lowest level of any previous expansionary period since 1961 Companies therefore have not experienced cost or margin pressures and so have not had to raise their product prices Consequently wages comprise the third green indicator From the above we can conclude that the classic warning signs of an overheating US economy and therefore impending global recession are not yet present That is not to say there are no reasons for concern Certainly the rise of protectionism the potential for monetary policy paralysis due to historically low interest rates and high government debt levels constraining fiscal policy are among the fundamental factors that are worrying economists Still investors shouldnt be nervous about investing in global equities because of the growth outlook On the contrary we believe it is a good idea to remain exposed to global equities However this is based on the current attractive valuations of global equities We dont believe in investing based on macroeconomic forecasting which is highly unreliable Instead we invest on the basis of asset valuations And if we examine current global equity valuations the very highrisk premiums and prospective real yields now available from many equity markets make this an excellent opportunity for investors to take advantage of Emergingmarket equities are looking especially well valued While US equities are somewhat expensive compared with their history our client portfolios are overweight in selected attractive markets These markets include Singapore Hong Kong SA and Turkey as well as Germany Italy and Japan which are all priced to deliver prospective real yields between 7 and 13 in US dollars over the next three to five years Though we dont know exactly how or when these returns will be delivered over time history has shown that current valuations should produce investor returns well above the longterm average And lets not forget that global equity is an excellent diversifier for any investor willing to tolerate its relatively high volatility Knee is chief investment officer at Prudential Investment Managers Fiscal fisticuffs While the trade war between China and US is contributing to a global economic slowdown there are no real signs that the world is heading for a recession 123RFaquir  "

zone As a result of pilot tests the volume of additional oil production at four inclined injection wells amounted to 1500 tons since the start of the first well in early February 2019 The introduction of the best practice and new technologies is one of the key areas of the Rosneft2022 Strategy The Company pays special attention to innovative development recognising technology leadership as a key competitive factor on the oil market Operating principal of the new technology is to create gas pulses of varying intensity in the reservoir with the use of a special generator which is lowered into the well Pulse ontime is from 03 to 15 seconds The pulse cleans the bottomhole formation zone therefore improving the permeability of the rock and increasing well flow rate The entity plans to test the application of innovative technology in wells with horizontal completion to rebound their productivity In the next three years the share of all promising technologies will be up to 25 of the total number of operations in the bottomhole formation zone treatment at RNPurneftegaz   OAO Tatneft MCX TATN  Neste to divest its fuel retail business in Russia and sell it to PJSC Tatneft  572019 Neste

Research Sanctions and public opinion The case of the RussiaUkraine gas disputes William Seitz and Alberto Zazzaro Abstract Economic sanctions usually fail sometimes even provoking the opposite of the intended outcome Why are sanctions so often ineffective One prominent view is that sanctions generate popular support for the targeted government and its policies an outcome referred to as the rallyaroundtheflag effect We quantify this effect in the context of a major trade dispute between Ukraine and the Russian Federation which led to a cut in gas exports to Ukraine and a sharp increase of gas prices Using individual data on political and economic preferences before and after the trade dispute and exploiting the cross section heterogeneity in the individual exposure to the price shockmeasured by the connection to a centralized gasheating systemwe find that people more directly affected by the increase of gas prices were significantly more likely to change their opinions in support of Westernstyle political and economic systems preferred by the incumbent government consistent with a rallyaroundtheflag effect httpslinkspringercomarticle101007s11558019093602 The Industry Petroleum industry in Russia The petroleum industry in Russia is one of the largest in the world Russia has the largest reserves and is the largest exporter of natural gas It has the second largest coal reserves the eighth largest oil reserves and is one of the largest producers of oil It is the third largest energy user Russia produced an average of 1083 million barrels 1722000 m3 of oil per day in December 2015 It produces 12 of the worlds oil and has a similar share of global oil exports In June 2006 Russian crude oil and condensate production reached the postSoviet maximum of 97 million barrels 1540000 m3 per day Exceeding production in 2000 by 32 Mbbld 510000 m3d Russian exports consist of more than 5 Mbbld 790000 m3d of oil and nearly 2 Mbbld 320000 m3d of refined products which go mainly to the European market The domestic demand in 2005 was 26 Mbbld 410000 m3d on average It is also the main transit country for oil from Kazakhstan Russia is by far the worlds largest natural gas exporter Most but not all authorities believe that Russia has the worlds largest proven reserves of natural gas Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US CIA 476 trillion cubic meters6 the US Energy Information Administration 478 tcmand OPEC 487 tcm However BP credits Russia with only 313 tcm as of 1 January 2014 which would place it in second place slightly behind Iran 331 to 338 tcm depending on the source In addition to having the worlds largest proven reserves of natural gas according to US Geological Survey estimations Russia is also likely to have the worlds largest volume of stillundiscovered natural gas a mean probable volume of 67 trillion cubic meters The USGS estimate of Russias undiscovered oil is 22 billion barrels

bln which is 135 higher yearonyear mainly due to weaker ruble and higher volumes of oil and gas sales outside Russia driven by higher production volumes along with increase in crude oil trading volumes The sales dynamics has been restrained by lower hydrocarbon prices in US dollar terms along with lower volumes of refined products wholesale sales outside Russia mostly owing to reduction in trading volumes Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 our sales decreased by 94 mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices and reduction in crude oil and refined products trading volumes EBITDA Despite lower sales our EBITDA in the first quarter of 2019 amounted to RUB 2981 bln up 358 yearonyear and 71 quarteronquarter Compared to both periods EBITDA dynamics benefited from higher gas production volumes outside Russia bigger share of highmargin barrels in the total crude oil production in Russia lower lifting costs per barrel positive crude oil export duty lag effect adoption of the tax on additional income from hydrocarbon production for certain license areas positive inventory effect in the refining segment as well as increase in retail margins The yearonyear EBITDA growth was also supported by weaker ruble and higher refinery throughput volumes EBITDA growth was constrained by lower international hydrocarbon prices external limitations on oil production in Russia as well as lower refining margins in Russia and Europe Profit for the period Profit attributable to shareholders totaled RUB 1492 bln up 368 yearonyear The growth was restrained with higher DDA due to the launch of new production facilities Despite higher EBITDA the profit declined quarteronquarter by 62 mainly due to higher DDA following its reduction in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by oneoff upward revision of the proved developed reserves Capital expenditures In the first quarter of 2019 capital expenditures were RUB 974 bln which is 140 lower quarteronquarter and 195 lower yearonyear mainly due to the payment schedule to suppliers and contractors as well as external limitations on oil production in Russia Free cash flow In the first quarter of 2019 our free cash flow before changes in working capital amounted to RUB 1833 bln up 955 yearonyear and 328 quarteronquarter The growth was attributable to higher operating cash flow before changes in working capital and lower capital expenditures Higher working capital in the first quarter of 2019 was due to refined products inventory buildup within international trading business as well as increase in crude oil inventories at our refineries outside Russia IFRS 16 The adoption of the IFRS 16 Leases as of January 1 2019 led to an increase in our total debt by RUB 1496 bln The positive effect on EBITDA totaled RUB 87 bln due to lower operating transportation and SGA expenses The positive effect on free cash flow reached RUB 116 bln owing to an increase in operating cash flow and reduction in capital expenditures The positive effect on profit for the period amounted to RUB 42 bln due to foreign exchange gain on additional debt  In the first quarter of 2019 LUKOIL Groups average hydrocarbon production excluding the West Qurna2 project reached 2379 thousand boe per day which is 41 higher yearonyear and 03 higher quarteronquarter The increase was mainly driven by the development of international gas projects Liquid hydrocarbons Liquid hydrocarbon production excluding the West Qurna2 project in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 1792 thousand barrels per day which is 16 higher yearonyear and 05 lower quarteronquarter LUKOIL Groups oil production volumes and dynamics are mainly defined by the external limitations of the production volumes in Russia The active development of the priority projects continued In particular in the first quarter of 2019 oil production at the V Filanovsky field increased by 18 yearonyear The seventh well was commissioned at the second production platform of the field In the first quarter of 2019 oil production at the Yu Korchagin field increased by 27 yearonyear as a result of drilling program at the fields second development stage The development of the Yaregskoye field and Permian reservoir of the Usinskoye field including the launch of new steamgenerating capacities allowed increasing high viscous oil production in the first quarter of 2019 by 16 yearonyear to 12 million tonnes The development of growth projects in West Siberia also continued Overall oil and gas condensate production at the V Vinogradov Imilorskoye and Pyakyakhinskoye fields increased in the first quarter of 2019 by 14 yearonyear The share of the abovementioned projects in the LUKOIL Groups oil production excluding the West Qurna2 project amounted to 18 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the 15 in the first quarter of 2018 Gas In the first quarter of 2019 LUKOIL Groups gas production amounted to 90 billion cubic meters which is 12 higher yearonyear The main driver of gas production growth was the development of projects in Uzbekistan As a result of the launch of the second stage at Kandym gas processing plant production in Uzbekistan in the first quarter of 2019 increased to 38 billion cubic meters LUKOILs share which is 33 higher yearonyear The production growth was also supported by the launch of the second stage of Shah Deniz project in Azerbaijan in 2018 Refined products In the first quarter of 2019 LUKOIL Group produced 157 million tons of refined products at own refineries which is 43 higher yearonyear mainly driven by higher utilization rates at refineries in Nizhny Novgorod Perm as well as in Bulgaria and Italy Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the production of refined products decreased by 34 mainly owing to reduction in refining volumes at the European refineries because of feedstock supply interruptions from Novorossiysk Sea Port on the back of bad weather conditions Russian refineries increased production of

million tonnes2 LPG sales volumes increased by 123 to 15 million tonnes Naphtha sales rose by 475 to 298 thousand tonnes Polypropylene sales decreased by 91 to 130 thousand tonnes due to a maintenance shutdown in Tobolsk at the beginning of the year Polyethylene sales volumes decreased by 67 to 63 thousand tonnes due to maintenance work to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the product in Tomsk Plastics and organic synthesis products sales volumes decreased by 38 to 190 thousand tonnes mainly due to the PET accumulation programme in anticipation of a planned maintenance shutdown as well as the accumulation of alcohol reserves prior to the launch of DOTP production in Perm Sales volumes of elastomers increased by 96 to 136 thousand tonnes mainly due to an increase in the volume of longterm contracts with tire companies Financial results 		For the first three months of 2019 revenue increased by 90 yearonyear to RUB 131 billion with the following dynamics across segments 		Olefins  Polyolefins revenue increased by 41 to RUB 237 billion mainly due to positive price dynamics in Ruble terms for products in the segment due to the depreciation of the Ruble In turn this growth was offset by a slight decrease in revenue from sales of polyethylene due to a decrease in sales volumes 		Plastics Elastomers  Intermediates revenue increased by 51 to RUB 382 billion largely due to positive price dynamics in Ruble terms for most products and higher sales volumes of elastomers 		Revenue from the Midstream segment increased by 182 to RUB 592 billion due to growth in sales volumes of LPG and naphtha as well as positive price dynamics for LPG in Ruble terms due to the depreciation of the Ruble compared to the same period in 2018 EBITDA increased by 45 to RUB 442 billion as a result of a 58 increase in EBITDA in the Olefins  Polyolefins segment and a 72 increase in Midstream segment due to positive dynamics in selling prices This was partially offset by a decrease in EBITDA in the Plastics Elastomers  Intermediates segment due to a shortterm increase in the share of raw materials purchased from third parties during a planned shutdown of terephthalic acid production while upgrading and capacity expansion works were carried out in Blagoveshchensk At 337 there was little change in EBITDA margin compared to the first quarter of 2018 Net profit increased by 715 to RUB 460 billion mainly due to the revaluation of debts denominated in foreign currency Borrowings As of 31 March 2019 total debt amounted to RUB 3499 billion an increase of 53 compared to 31 December 2018 The increase was mainly due to the inclusion of lease obligations due to the Groups adoption of IFRS 16 since 1 January 2019 as well as an increase in conventional debt and new drawdowns of ZapSibrelated financing The increase was partially compensated by the currency revaluation of the credit portfolio due to the appreciation of the Ruble during the quarter Net debt5 as of 31 March 2019 increased by 50 compared with 31 December 2018 to RUB 3335 billion The net debt to EBITDA ratio was 16x as of 31 March 2019

"2019_8";"BA Submits Plans for First WastetoJet Fuel Plant in UKtxt";" The UK has become the most fertile proving ground in Europe for sustainable aviation fuels SAF thanks to broadbased government support British Airways BA Royal Dutch Shell and sustainable fuels firm Velocys have finally submitted their planning application to build Europes first commercial wastetojet fuel plant Collectively known as Altalto the group said in the Aug 20 filing that they hoped to start construction of the plant at Immingham in northeast England in 2021 with first commercial production of SAF expected from 2024 The Altalto Immingham plant will convert 500000 metric tons per year of household and office waste  otherwise destined for landfill or incineration  into 60 million liters per year of SAF and bionaphtha  Sustainable fuels can be a game changer for aviation which will help power our aircraft for years to come said BA Chairman and CEO Alex Cruz in an Aug 20 announcement This development is an important step in the reduction of our carbon emissions It also brings the UK another step closer to becoming a global leader in sustainable aviation fuels he added Supply logistics are key in Europes importdependent jet fuel market while fuel blending is crucial when handling SAF The synthetic paraffinic kerosene produced by the FischerTropsch process that Velocys uses has already been approved worldwide for commercial aviation at blends of up to 50 with conventional jet fuel Immingham is an existing entry point into the UKs main CLHPS jet fuel pipeline system and has two conventional oil refineries close by Totals 200000 barrel per day Immingham refinery and Phillips 66s 220000 bd Killingholme plant  JFI Jul2219  Field Consulting Director Rob Jeffery who is overseeing the Altalto Immingham project told Energy Intelligence that around 8 million has been spent on the project so far by the three project partners plus 434000 from the UK government The total of cost of the project is expected to run into hundreds of millions of pounds BA has committed to take the bulk of SAF production for its own aircraft with Shell expected to take some SAF production for resale to its aviation customers and all bionaphtha output for use in its own gasoline blends The jet fuel coming from the plant could fuel all British Airways 787 Dreamliner operated flights from London to San Jose California and New Orleans in a year Jeffrey said The global airline sector is working toward carbonneutral growth from 2020 and a 50 reduction in emissions from 2005 levels by 2050 using the UNs global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation known as Corsia Those targets will be met using a combination of carbon trading and SAF triggering a surge in SAF projects across Europe BA says SAF from Altalto offers a 70 saving in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel with a 90 reduction in exhaust soot and complete elimination of sulfur oxides It claims the Immingham plants SAF output will be equivalent to taking 40000 cars off of UK roads Once proof of concept has been established at Immingham Altalto has ambitious plans for around 10 SAF plants in the UK Dutch firm SkyNRG is aiming for construction of multiple SAF plants with direct supply lines to airports across Europe Other plans in Europe mostly involve conversion of conventional oil refineries to biorefineries including Nestes renewable fuels plants at Porvoo Finland and Rotterdam in the Netherlands  JFI Apr2219  Just last month French oil company Total began making biodiesel and SAF at its former La Mede refinery in southeast France following the plants 275 million 310 million fouryear conversion into a biorefinery  JFI Jul819  BA has previously told Energy Intelligence that its original preferred site at Coryton at the mouth of the Thames  reasonably close to Londons Heathrow Airport  had become too expensive following the development of the new Thames Gateway container port BA used the Aug 20 announcement to call for even more UK government support of SAF The airlines lobbying efforts have already succeeded in jet fuels inclusion in the UKs Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation RTFO from next year We strongly believe a dedicated Office for Sustainable Aviation Fuels will provide the essential crossgovernment coordination necessary to progress the development and commercial deployment of sustainable aviation fuel and would welcome government support in setting this up at the earliest opportunity urged Jonathan Counsell the head of sustainability at BAs parent company International Airline Group We welcomed the inclusion of sustainable aviation fuels into the renewable transport fuels policy framework and call on Government to continue to provide support given the significant nearterm opportunities offered by these fuels he added Jet fuels inclusion in the UK RTFO from 2020 will allow SAF producers to make an extra 160 per liter 734 per gallon from selling RFTO certificates alongside the fuel Velocys Business Development Director for Europe Neville Hargreaves told Energy Intelligence last year that the UK governments decision on RTFO was a crucial factor in Velocys decision to build wastetojet plants in the UK rather than elsewhere in Europe  JFI Jul1618   "

"2019_8";"Global economic outlook appears dimtxt";" WASHINGTON  As global leaders gather on two continents to take account of a darkening economic outlook this is the picture they face Factories are slumping many businesses are paralyzed global growth is sputtering and the worlds two mightiest economies are in the grip of a dangerous trade war Barely a year after most of the worlds major countries were enjoying an unusual moment of shared prosperity the global economy may be at risk of returning to the rut it tumbled into after the financial crisis of 20072009 Worse solutions seem far from obvious Central banks cant just slash interest rates Rates are already ultralow And even if they did the central banks would risk robbing themselves of the ammunition they would need later to fight a recession Whats more high government debts make it politically problematic to cut taxes or pour money into new bridges roads and other public works projects Our tools for fighting recession are no doubt more limited than in the past said Karen Dynan an economist at Harvard Universitys Kennedy School The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have downgraded the outlook for worldwide growth On Thursday Moodys Investors Service said it expects the global economy to expand 27 this year and next  down from 32 the previous two years And it issued a dark warning Get used to it The new normal will likely continue for the next three to four years the credit rating agency said Concerns are rising just as central bankers meet in Jackson Hole Wyoming and leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies gather this weekend in the resort town of Biarritz in southwestern France A spotlight will shine in particular on whatever message Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sends in a speech Friday in Jackson Hole The dour global outlook partly reflects President Donald Trumps combative trade conflicts with China and other countries A realization has taken hold that Trump likely will keep deploying tariffs  and in some cases escalating them  to try to beat concessions out of US trading partners The trade uncertainty is here to stay said Madhavi Bokil senior credit officer at Moodys Squeezed by tightening protectionism global trade is likely to grow just 25 this year its slowest pace in three years the IMF says Manufacturers whose fortunes are closely tied to trade are struggling JP Morgans global manufacturing index dropped in July for a third straight month hitting the lowest level since 2012 The global funk also reflects the pull of gravity The economies of Europe and Japan fueled by central banks easymoney policies overexerted themselves a couple of years ago and are now returning to their more typical state Sluggishness The IMF expects Chinas economy the worlds second biggest to grow 62 this year  the weakest since 1990  and just 6 next year Trumps trade war is certainly a factor The president has imposed tariffs on 250 billion in Chinese imports and is set to tax nearly 300 billion more before years end Chinas slowdown is also being orchestrated in part by the officials in Beijing who are trying to contain lending to control the countrys runaway debts And an economic chill in China sends shivers into the many countries  from copperproducing Chile to iron oremaking Australia  that feed Chinese factories with raw materials Then theres Europe In the 19 countries that use the euro currency growth slowed to an anemic 02 in the second quarter from the quarter before The eurozone which maintains close trade ties with the US and China has been sideswiped by the collision between Trump and President Xi Jinping Whats more Trump has threatened to impose significant tariffs on European auto imports Even more than the tariffs themselves uncertainty over whether the trade disputes will be resolved is chilling investment and purchasing Despite cheap borrowing costs from central bank stimulus investment in new plants is lagging  an ominous sign that bosses dont foresee future prosperity In Europes usual economic powerhouse Germany the economy shrank 01 in the second quarter from the quarter before If output should fall for a second straight quarter  Germany would find itself on the verge of a recession Some of Germanys troubles originate closer to home Its major automakers have been compelled to sink billions into technology to meet stricter emissions tests and some have endured delays in doing so BMW lost money on its car business for the first time in a decade in the first quarter Daimler posted its first net loss since 2009 in the second quarter Brexit is another risk for Europe Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the UK will leave the 28country European Union and its freetrade zone on Oct 31 with or without a divorce deal Not knowing what will happen is a nagging source of uncertainty Facing such risks the European Central Bank has signaled that it could launch new monetary stimulus as early as next month As recently as December the ECB had been confident enough in the European economy to halt a nearly fouryear 29 trillion bond purchase program That optimism has vanished"
"2019_8";"Global economic slowdown set to hit Pakistan s exportstxt";" A worker inspects a piece of fabric ahead of stitching at a textile manufacturer in Karachi InternewsKarachi Troubled Pakistans economy is feared to face a shockwave as most global economic data harbouring an undercurrent recession shows it could hurt the countrys export sector and impede remittance inflows analysts and economists said But some of them also find rescuer to feeble external account position in downward trend in oil prices Former finance minister Hafeez Pasha said Pakistans exports would be going further down because of global economic downturn Remittances from workers abroad are likely to slow down Pasha said This will lead to a further reduction in the FDI foreign direct investment flows as well Mohammed Sohail chief executive officer at Topline Securities agreed with the viewpoints Growth in exports along with dollar remittances would be affected he said However if oil prices fall sharply it will be a blessing Global oil prices tumbled more than 22 since April And alone in August they fell 20 compared to the corresponding month a year earlier despite severe US sanctions on oil exports from Iran and Venezuela Prices of nonoil commodity prices have also been declining or remained flat since the middle of last year as consumption has been curtailed The global economy is in the midst of the deepest slowdown since 2015 and in many cases since 2009 according to local media However it is believed that the US economy is still strong and if headwinds created by the trade war between the US and China can be avoided the global economy can extend its expansionary phase for quite sometimes Economist Ashfaque Hasan Khan said the world is heading towards another great recession like of 200708 He believed that lower oil prices could curb the countrys import bill but they would drive a further deterioration in the current account gap in times ahead If the oil prices in the Opec Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries continue to decline they will drive down real economic activity and soften demand for expatriate manpower which will ultimately put negative impacts on remittance receiving countries like Pakistan Khan a member of the staterun Economic Advisory Council said Exports are likely to suffer due to slowdown in global trade and external demand The prolonged weakness in exports will not be in favour of the external current account Falling exports is one of the biggest issue faced by the countrys economy Exports posted a dismal performance during the last fiscal year as they fell 1 to 2297bn in FY2019 Remittances however rose 968 to 21841bn in the last fiscal year The current account deficit fell 32 to 13587bn in FY2019 compared with 19897bn in preceding fiscal year The government is projecting the current account deficit to reduce further in FY2020 on the back of an expected better export performance containment of import payments and continued momentum in workers remittances However downside risks persist in the wake of a slowdown in global economy attributed to escalated trade war between USChina and uncertainty in Europe the central bank said in a report Growth fell to 33 in the last fiscal year from 55 a year earlier Economic pickup will be gradual and painful especially after unpopular reforms taken by this government analyst Yaqoob Abubakar from Tresmark an application that tracks financial markets said Geopolitical tension between India and Pakistan agricultural loss due to heavy rains and lack of financial aid may further slow down recovery Bilal Khan a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank said softer global growth outlook poses additional risks to Pakistan as the country looks to rebalance its external sector particularly efforts to increase exports We expect growth in Pakistan to slow to 2 in FY2020 on the back of tighter fiscal and monetary policies and structural reforms Hasan Khan underscored a need of economic stimulus to calm fears of global recession I think there is no need for any further tight monetary policy he added The central bank must consider downward revision in the interest rates to protect the economy from suffocation Khan of Standard Chartered however expects the SBP to maintain the policy rate at 1325 through the current fiscal year  even as global central banks adopt more accommodative stance Given the IMF International Monetary Fund programmes focus on macroeconomic stabilisation we believe fiscal and monetary space to boost growth may remain limited in the nearterm he added Pakistan agreed to a 6bn IMFs loan last month Muhammad Yaqub the central banks former governor said Pakistan has an insignificant share in world export trade and with appropriate exchange rate and fiscal policies its exports growth can be maintained Pakistans economic problems are of its own creation and their resolution basically depends on domestic structural economic reforms rather than what happens to the global economy Yaqub said Even if it is assumed that global economic recession is likely to develop in the foreseeable future its impact on Pakistan economy is likely to be minimum and its performances will basically continue to be driven by its policies to reduce the budget and balance of payments deficits Yaqub said the flow of direct foreign investment is determined by the investment environment security and economic policies rather than by developments abroad "

sector to the shift to service sector economies Is technological advancement necessarily good for the economy We need to be careful with the concept of disruption Marc says Were seeing a lack of global inflationary pressure and innovation is often a race to the bottom in terms of costcutting which plays out most severely for the workforceIs that positive For consumers yes but if its coming at a huge cost in terms of wages we have a problem We need to make sure we dont end up praying at the altar of innovation and assuming its all goodItalys debt crisis has once more come under scrutiny recently but is it as critical a problem as many commentators believe Italy has a debt problem and a lot of it sits on the balance sheets of Italian banks but its still a wealthy country and it has among the lowest mortgage debt to GDP ratio of any developed country Marc saysThe deep visceral fear of global market psychologyHow does he see the generalmarket psychologyat this point The pendulum swings violently between what appears to be irrational exuberance into deep visceral fearThe longer the financial repression goes on the harder it will be for people to generate easy income without a high level of risk in their portfolio Investment opportunities now reside in looking at every country on its own merit  to a greater extent than in the past Were looking at the developing world and working out what we want to target The axis of power has shifted away from the EU NATO and North America and towards Asia and the Shanghai Cooperation OrganizationAlso the world of macroinvesting has

but I dont think things have moved very sharply and we dont get the type of movements we saw during the Plaza Accord for example Marc is impressed by how resilient Japans domestic economy is proving to be citing more similarity between Japan and the US at the moment than for a long time Theyve got so many headwinds blowing on the export side yet the economy is still doing quite well and domestic demand is pretty robust So purely on that basis the Yen doesnt look that overvaluedAn environment where global trade is growing is one thats bad forUSD  Marc says A lot of developing economies accumulate a lot more in the way of trade surpluses those trade surpluses are recycled in foreign exchange reserves and these foreign exchange reserves are initially always accumulated in US Dollars and then diversified which Is why its a negative for the DollarHow aboutgold  If we see major economy interest rates start to rise interest ingoldwill be diminishedThe benefit is that the opportunity cost of holding gold which doesnt generate income of its own other than the price is so low compared to holding negativeyielding eurozone government bonds that you can see the attraction of gold or even digital currencies Putting your money in that asset is better than paying governments to borrow from you Marc points to opportunities incommodities  Theyve been under a cloud for a long time and

Market  Jet fuel also referred to as Aviation Turbine Fuel ATF is a petroleumbased fuel that powers turbopropelled and jet engine aircraft The rising demand for air cargo transportation is expected to boost the segments growth This in turn will drive the aviation fuel market growth Jet fuels are highvalue light petroleum products processed from crude oil These fuels are not only used in jet aircraft but in jet turbine applications too There are different grades of jet fuels called Jet A1 and Jet A The former is used for commercial purposes in international aviation and the latter is specifically for the US domestic aviation A growing number of air traffic passengers are expected to expand the airline industry As a matter of fact Boeing recently receives the highest order for manufacturing commercial air buses and cargos on account of an increasing number of Boeing passengers Other factors driving the jet fuel segment are better aircraft fuelburning efficiency growing international trade rising industrial production globally and better economic scenario The global aviation fuel market size is likely to increase owing to the rising demand for biojet fuel The types of fuel intend to mitigate the pollution levels and ensure sustainable air travel  Market to Benefit as Countries Plan to Increase their Defense Budget  As per the International Air Transport Association or IATA the number of air skyrocketed as it surpassed 4 billion for the first time This is attributable to the bettering economic conditions of developing economies and lessening airfares The aviation fuel market revenue is likely to increase as some of the countries are planning to increase their defense budget This is primarily done to enhance national security and also military plans a crucial role in aviation fuel consumption Hence not only commercial airplanes private jets and military jets consume aviation fuel This acts as potential growth triggers for the market  Rising per capita income of middleclass people now opt for airplanes for comfort and luxury thus boosting the aviation fuel market potential  said a lead analyst at Fortune Business insights This coupled with instability in crude oil prices enable growth in the market"
"2019_9";"Crude estimate Facilities face lengthy repairstxt";" The attacks on Saudi Arabias oil infrastructure targeted what one analyst called the Achilles heel of the world economy knocking out more than half of production capacity in the largest oil exporter and causing the secondbiggest intraday rise in the price of crude since the first Gulf war The main target of the airborne attacks which the US has blamed on Iran was the Abqaiq processing facility which has been exposed as a chokepoint for the kingdoms oil supplies The Khurais fields one of the worlds largest were also hit Abqaiq processes up to 70 per cent of Saudi Arabias production most of it for export The question for the oil market and by extension the world economy is how quickly it can be repaired Four people briefed on the matter said yesterday they believed it could be months before it is fully fixed What is Abqaiq The facility in the northeast is by far the most important oil facility in the world said Bob McNally former energy adviser to George W Bush as no other field or refinery handles so many barrels on any given day Mr McNallys Rapidan consultancy which advises energy companies and oil trading hedge funds flagged in May the facility was a systemic vulnerability as without it the world would lose about 7m barrels a day of crude supplies or 7 per cent of the total If you are making and monitoring a list of critical energy infrastructure Abqaiq belongs at the very top he said Connected to some of the worlds largest oilfields by pipelines including Saudi Arabias supergiant Ghawar the site consists of a complex mix of equipment used to prepare oil for export They do this by removing impurities such as sulphur and heavy metals that have the potential to damage refining equipment once the crude has been sold and shipped overseas Gas associated with crude oil production is also extracted from the mix to be sold separately or burnt in Saudi Arabian power stations Natural gas liquids such as propane and butane are separated off from the crude to be sold Saudi Arabia has said the attacks have forced the loss of 57m barrels a day of crude production 700000 bd of NGLs and a large amount of the kingdoms natural gas output What did the attacks target The attacks which were first claimed to have been carried out with drones by Iranianbacked Houthi militias in Yemen appear to have been coordinated US officials are reported to have suggested they suspect missiles were part of the attack Commercial satellite imagery released by the US shows a number of spheroid domes used to separate gas from the crude and to stabilise it for export which appear to have been hit About half of the desulphurisation towers used to clean out highly corrosive substances from the oil have also been affected according to Energy Aspects a consultancy While Saudi Aramco the state oil company is likely to be pouring resources into starting repairs  and as the worlds most profitable company it has deep enough pockets  suspicions are growing it could take a long time to restore the facility to full working order It is not the first time Abqaiq has been attacked Security was increased after alQaeda launched an unsuccessful operation on the facility in 2006 with Saudi Arabias enemies aware of its strategic significance Will repairs be straightforward Most likely not While information is still relatively sparse one refining engineer who has worked at Abqaiq said the complexity and specialist nature of the various units at the site meant it would take time There are no offtheshelf replacement components and if any units need to be replaced the task is likely to be complex The spheroids will need to be drained cleaned and inspected Repairs would involve a lengthy procedure of joining together thick plate steel They would need to be pressuretested to ensure they are safe Most nonengineers underestimate the time to do anything the refining engineer said Analysts at Bernstein Research say that given the complexity of the system even planned maintenance can take up to three months Stuart Joyner at Redburn a research firm said the jump in oil prices at one point 20 per cent reflects growing pessimism about a quick repair to the facilities How can the impact be mitigated The kingdom has options but none is without downside Its first response will be to bring oil out of storage to maintain exports both from domestic stockpiles and from inventories held overseas But draining its own stockpiles may leave the market more nervous about future supply outages and inventories are already said to be low Kpler a data intelligence company said yesterday that its tracking of Saudi crude suggested the kingdom had less than 100m barrels in inventories available for the market That could be drained in little over a month even if Saudi Arabia can get about half of its lost output back online Saudi Arabias remaining crude oil production will also probably be prioritised for export and redirected away from its own refining system But this will necessitate Saudi Arabia buying more gasoline diesel and jet fuel on the open market It may also try and raise production at other fields that are not as reliant on Abqaiq though this would leave the world with very little spare capacity Saad Rahim chief economist at Trafigura one of the worlds biggest independent oil traders said The fundamental question if whether the market starts to question the longterm security of Saudi supply This is the Achilles heel of the global economy "
"2019_9";"Drone Strikes On Saudi Oil Highlight Risks For Global Economytxt";" The drone strike on Saudi Arabias oil infrastructure has highlighted the fragile and interconnected relationship between crude oil supply and the global economy with new research bringing these economic ties into greater focus We shouldnt underestimate the importance of geopolitical events in the oil market as it has the power to impend the stability of our financial world says University of Technology Sydney Finance researcher Dr Christina Sklibosios Nikitopoulos On 16 September 2019 the oil market witnessed one of the highest intraday moves with a 15 increase in Brent oil prices and an 147 increase in US WTI oil futures Oil price spikes are seen as a recession barometer but it is not just price but also volatility that matters she says In a recently released paper Dr Nikitopoulos with colleagues Dr Boda Kang from Lacima Group and Finance Professor Marcel Prokopczuk from Leibniz University Hannover examined the connections between oil futures volatility and the global economy Oil markets should be the focus of global discussions by policy makers not just individual decisions from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission or OPEC Dr Christina Sklibosios Nikitopoulos They looked at 30 years of data to discover economic determinants of oil futures volatility over the short medium and longterm These included oilsector variables financial variables and macroeconomic conditions The research revealed how deeply integrated crude oil markets have become with financial markets The crude oil derivatives market has provided a rollercoaster of volatility for market participants Investors increasingly regard commodities as an alternative asset class to equities or bonds and crude oil derivatives are the most actively traded commodity says Dr Nikitopoulos Oil futures started trading in 1983 and options in 1986 and since then the market has experienced explosive growth Daily trading volume has leapt from 21997 contracts in 2012 to 16 million in 2016 and this week surpassed 2 million Our study highlighted the importance of risk premiums in this market and revealed that credit spreads play a significant role in determining shortterm and mediumterm variation in oil futures prices she says In the bond market term structure  the rate at which people can borrow or lend over different periods is seen as an important economic signal  whether the yield term is up signalling growth or down signalling recession Term structures in oil markets can be seen in a similar light where contango where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price or backwardation where the spot or cash price of a commodity is higher than the forward price provide an economic signal Dr Nikitopoulos says the expected supply shortfall following the drone strike would cause oil futures markets to remain in backwardation for a while The researchers found that along with hedging pressure and VIX an equities market volatility index after 2004 the beginning of the financialisation of the commodity markets credit spreads industrial production and the US dollar index were all drivers of shortterm volatility This supports the notion of volatility spillovers between equity and commodity markets which has strengthened in the past 10 years says Dr Nikitopoulos It also supports the notion that oil volatility acts as a recession barometer and fears about the impact of oil shocks on financial stability are justified she says Mediumterm volatility was consistently related to open interest a measure of trading activity and credit spreads while oil sector variables such as inventory and consumption had a measurable impact after 2004 due to structural changes in the economy and the oil sector Dr Nikitopoulos argues that because oil futures volatility is a product of interaction between the oilsector and the economy there is a need for mutually consistent policies Oil markets should be the focus of global discussions by policy makers not just individual decisions from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission or OPEC she says Crude oil futures volatility plays an important role in the global economy and has significant implications for market participants  from oil producers and institutional investors to traders and market regulators And while the US economy can manage this most recent oil shock with its own shale oil production and opening of strategic reserves it is global markets like Australia that suffer the most through an increase in fuel costs she says "

"2019_9";"Global Economytxt";" Dhaka Sept 5  The past few weeks have been a tumultuous ride for the global economy as the USChina trade war unexpectedly escalated and the new UK Prime Ministers hardline approach to leaving the European Union has boosted fears that a nodeal Brexit may very well occur on October 31 There was further evidence of a global slowdown notably in Germany and China Geopolitical events have also been in the news including the rising tensions in Hong Kong and the dissolution of the Italian government Financial markets have reacted strongly to this complex turbulent picture Equity markets have been volatile Longterm bond rates around the world have moved down sharply to near postcrisis lows Meanwhile the US economy has continued to perform well overall driven by strong consumer sentiment and spending Job creation has slowed from last years pace but is still above labour force growth Inflation seems to be moving up closer to 2 However clouds are gathering across other parts of the global economy including from a pronounced escalation in trade policy uncertainty With shortterm interest rates already low the US Federal Reserve has little room to cut borrowing costs to spur spending and investment as it usually does in a slowdown Meantime the federal debt is exploding which could hamstring any efforts to boost growth with tax cuts or spending increases Another interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve might be needed to guard against the risk that a slowdown in US business investment and global manufacturing activity doesnt spill over into other parts of the domestic economy We dont think the US economy is headed towards a recession right now A glance at the incoming data shows solid domestic momentum that point to a continued though slowing economic expansion The labour market is strong consumer confidence is high and consumer spending is healthy However the trade war has aggravated a global economic slowdown that has weakened US manufacturing and business investment clouding an otherwise solid domestic outlook It is worth noting if weakness in global manufacturing activity seeps into the services sector and leads to a slowdown in hiring A couple of poor monthly payroll figures could in turn damage consumer confidence Tariffs President Trump announced another round of tariffs on 300 billion of Chinese imports that had thus far largely avoided becoming tangled up in the trade dispute President Trump stiffened tariffs on Chinese imports after Beijing unveiled its own new levies on American goods the latest twists in a trade war rattling investors and confounding central bankers The Presidents stance represented a new phase in his longstanding drive to shape US corporate planning to align with his desire to see US companies invest domestically and to force changes in Chinas behavior that he says harms US companies and consumers The uncertainty created by that strategy has posed continuous challenges to the Feds monetary policy with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell saying that the Fed stood ready to stimulate the economy as needed but that trade uncertainties compounded the risks to the global economic outlook US Dollar A prolonged dollar rally is pressuring US corporate earnings hitting commodity prices and threatening to deepen a selloff in emerging markets The US dollar has continued to grind higher this year despite an escalating trade fight with China and broadsides from President Trump who has complained that the dollars strength is curbing growth In July the dollar rose even after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in a decade defying expectations that lower rates would cut the appeal of US assets to yieldseeking investors One key driver of the dollars gains has been the relative strength of the US economy which since 2015 until recently has allowed the Fed to raise rates far above the levels of borrowing costs in other developed countries The gap in yields is likely to remain in place as central banks ease monetary policy to counter the effects of a global slowdown The strong dollar is a negative for US exporters and is also hurting US multinationals by making it more expensive for them to convert foreign revenues into US currency  a worrisome trend for investors betting on an earnings rebound in the second half of 2019 At the same time the dollars strength has made investors more cautious on emerging markets as a rising dollar makes it more expensive for these countries to service their dollardenominated debt pressuring those that have borrowed heavily in the US currency Commodities eg oil copper and most other raw materials have not only been buffeted by growth fears and the tradewar escalation they have also been hurt by the strengthening dollar These commodities are denominated in dollars and become more expensive to foreign buyers when the US currency appreciates China Chinas producer prices fell into deflation for the first time in three years as worries over the trade war with the US sapped demand adding another complication to Beijings efforts to shore up its slowing economy Factorygate prices act as a bellwether of industrial demand in China As trade tensions with the US escalate global demand for Chinese goods will erode further weighing on prices of industrial goods While producer prices fell 03 from a year earlier in July consumer prices edged up to a 17month high squeezing households spending power This presents a potential dilemma for Chinas central bank It could loosen monetary policy in a bid to stimulate demand and lift producer prices out of deflation but a massive stimulus program would risk pushing consumer inflation higher and cause the property market to overheat Eurozone The eurozone economy slowed sharply in the second quarter with growth at an annualized 08 rate in the three months through June a slowdown from 18 in the first three months of 2019 The drop in growth has been led by manufacturing particularly factories in Germany and Italy the two eurozone economies most dependent on the sector Continued trade uncertainty delivered a blow to manufacturing confidence which fell to its lowest level for six years in July However trade uncertainty isnt the only drag on European manufacturing Auto makers wrestling with new rules on carbon emissions and an anticipated shift away from gasoline have seen sales fall Consumer sentiment levels in Europe are also low consistent with levels that have historically preceded a recession The UKs departure from the EU is also a source of volatility There is now a heightened likelihood that the UK will leave the EU without an agreement to smooth its exit which would hit eurozone manufacturers The eurozones weakness makes it more likely that the European Central Bank will roll out new stimulus measures in September in an effort to limit the impact of the manufacturing sector on the rest of the economy which is in better shape Outlook Two developments in the last few weeks have had a pronounced impact on the global financial markets The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in over a decade and the USChina trade war has expanded to include tariffs on an additional 300 billion of goods coming into the US from China The trade war is harming business confidence leading to a visible pullback in investment that could eventually imperil job growth which has been healthy This rising uncertainty over trade policy adds to a growing list of geopolitical tensions including protests in Hong Kong Britains threat to crash out of the European Union on Oct 31 a political crisis in Italy that could roil the euro conflicts between Japan and South Korea and Indias military lockdown in the Kashmir region bordering Pakistan Despite the handwringing these events have caused in global financial markets the direct effects on economic growth are not terribly consequential That said turmoil in financial markets should it continue could sap consumer and business confidence These second order effects on the global economy could cause us to be less sanguine Political leaders are inflicting avoidable pain on the economy with little to show for it Central banks tools arent wellsuited to deal with the political sources of economic weakness Moreover with borrowing costs already low the Central Banks in developed countries have less room to cut interest rates to spur growth  "

The global economy is slowing because of the fading fiscal stimulus in the United States uncertainty over trade wars and other potential disruptions concentrated in Western Europe according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics PIIE Most large economies however are likely to continue to expand through 2020 even as the broad slowdown pushes interest rates down and the dollar up While the risk of recession has risen it is not as high or as impossible to counter as many fear These and other assessments are being presented today at PIIEs semiannual Global Economic Prospects event Karen Dynan nonresident senior fellow at PIIE and former chief economist at the US Department of Treasury will present her semiannual outlook for the US economy and the largest G20 economies Jean PisaniFerry PIIE visiting fellow and former commissionergeneral of France Strategie will take a deeper look at the major EU economies in light of Brexit political tensions and German manufacturing troubles Maurice Obstfeld PIIE nonresident senior fellow and former director of research at the International Monetary Fund IMF will assess how the international environment affects the US economy and should increasingly influence the Federal Reserves monetary policymaking Global economic growth is slowing due to a confluence of headwinds including waning fiscal stimulus in the United States higher trade barriers and uncertainty around future trade policy Brexit and other potential disruptions While broadly felt different economies are experiencing different degrees of drag The US economy is expected to expand 23 percent in 2019 and 18 percent in 2020down from nearly 3 percent in 2018 The household sector is likely to continue to be the main driver of US growth due to increased consumer spending Dynan cautions that the headwinds from the global slowdown and the escalating trade war with China have considerably increased the risk of recession in the United States She argues that US policymakers have sufficient tools to respond to a typical recession but will need the will to use them As the global economy slows in coming months disparity will prevail among the main European countries The outlook in the United Kingdom is dominated by Brexit the modalities of which are unlikely to be settled in time for an agreement before its scheduled departure from the European Union on October 31 Growth has stalled in Germany because of stagnating exports and Italy for domestic reasons while it is still buoyant in Spain and solid in France If a recession materializes PisaniFerry warns that the eurozone risks finding itself short of ammunition again depending upon political will With essentially no room for monetary action attention must turn to the narrow and uneven fiscal space at least within the current rules of the European fiscal pact He forecasts that Europes ambitious climate change mitigation transition could get around these selfimposed limits soon but is bound to have major longterm consequences for growth public finances and trade In the United States the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates twice so far in 2019 despite a US growth rate that remains above the economys longrun potential rate and an unemployment rate not seen since the 1960s In an analysis of global influences on US monetary policy Obstfeld points out that the Fed must adjust the US real interest rate in line with global forces to meet its domestic mandates of high employment and price stability As a result slower growth abroad can justify a reduction in US rates even if US growth remains relatively high Real interest rates appear to be persistently low across the globe however implying that many central banks including the Fed will have limited room to respond to a new recession Obstfeld points out that lower interest rates do however expand the budgetary space for fiscal easing which will have to play a bigger role in offsetting any future economic slowdown About the speakers Karen Dynan PIIE nonresident senior fellow and professor of the practice in the department of economics at Harvard University was assistant secretary for economic

"2019_11";"Jet Fuel Prices Buffeted By Macroeconomic Slowdowntxt";" Key View  Our moderated oil price view has subsequently prompted us to reduce our expectations for jet fuel prices through 2020 We now forecast an annual average of USD7500bbl in 2020 falling further to USD715bbl in 2021 Key drivers for jet fuel prices will remain the fluctuations in the price of oil as well as the expectations for weak macroeconomic conditions hitting air freight demand Macroeconomic headwinds could mean more of a change in the composition of trade and air transport demand with less freight demand but less of an impact on passenger kilometers travelled This will be dependent on how elastic travel demand is to reduced economic activity globally      Data accurate as of November 20th f  Fitch Solutions forecast Source Bloomberg Fitch Solutions    Our lower crude oil price expectations for the next two years has prompted a reduction in the jet fuel forecasts We now see jet fuel prices dropping to an annual average of USD7500bbl in 2020 The somewhat languid performance for global Brent crude prices through 2019 has seen jet fuel prices stagnate through the year to date with prices hovering around USD770bbl For Brent which remains the most important price driver for jet fuel across 2019 supply and demand have pulled prices in opposite directions Supply has contracted yoy dragged lower by the cutbacks made by OPEC and Russia sanctions in place on Venezuela and Iran and pipeline bottlenecks and spending pullbacks in the US shale patch Demand meanwhile has fallen off a cliff driven down by weakening global trade and economic activity and a host of more localised headwinds to growth Shifts in the term structure of Brent futures the strength in physical markets relative to paper ones and drawdowns in global crude inventories would all suggest that the market has tightened This though has proved insufficient to pull Brent sustainably back into the USD600700bbl range Ultimately sentiment has trumped fundamentals with USChina trade tensions casting a long shadow over the market  Jet Fuel Prices Hit By Brent Stagnation  Regional Jet Fuel Prices USDbbl   Source Bloomberg Fitch Solutions  For 2020 The main takeaway is that from the bottom up conditions seem more supportive of demand and this is reflected in our forecasts However the view from the top down is less clear cut On the one hand our global headline GDP growth forecast suggests a relatively benign economic environment next year Increasing fiscal and monetary stimulus measures should prove supportive while low base effects from 2019 will flatter growth rates in a number of markets But the risks to this forecast are skewed heavily to the downside Our economists have recently made a number of downward

October 18 and Quick View US Q3 Growth Suggests Investment Likely To Remain A Drag October 30 Significantly most of the damage is being done by weakness in global trade and manufacturing activity and

Forecasts Since May    Source Fitch Solutions  These macroeconomic headwinds moderating our growth outlook will impact the demand for jet fuel and also have a particular impact on demand for jet fuel from the air freight sector A slowdown in the levels of air cargo and freight has been visible through the YTD driven by the deteriorating global trade environment Air freights share of world trade is always very cyclical Whenever there is an economic downturn shippers reduce their exposure to more expensive air freight in favour of slower and cheaper options  Passenger Demand Holding Up Overall Growth Slowing  Passenger Travel By Region Revenue Person Kilometers   Source Bloomberg Fitch Solutions  For passenger demand the growth in passenger volumes has remained fairly robust through 2019 However 2019 growth yearonyear is trending lower Our expectations for further weakness in global economic conditions through 2020 will continue to weigh on air travel demand particularly if business and leisure travel demand starts to become affected by headwinds to household incomes and employment and as stimulus to demand from lower airfares a result of lower wholesale costs for airlines fades Air traffic has historically been largely correlated with economic growth and we maintain that the global airline industry will continue seeing strong demand over our forecast period supported by a growing population growing middle classes with the spending power to afford air travel as well as positive growth in the global economy However our expectations for several years of moderated economic growth before a slow recovery from 2023 will slow the rate of demand growth and subsequently continue to weigh on jet fuel prices Regionally we expect AsiaPacific to continue to lead growth rates

"2019_11";"Trade dispute hurting global economytxt";" There are increasing fears that the trade dispute between the United States and China the biggest in modern economic history could destabilize the global economy The 19monthlong standoff is hitting US consumers and the countrys agriculture sector in particular as well as affecting business confidence in China Whether there is a socalled phase one deal before Dec 15 when the US is scheduled to impose new tariffs of 15 percent mainly on Chinese consumer goods is not clear nor is Chinas response if that is the case Jeff Moon president of the consultancy China Moon Strategies in Washington believes it is important that a resolution is reached soon This trade war is the biggest threat to the global economy I dont know how to quantify it because it can be measured in so many different ways But theres no doubt that its a serious problem and it needs to be resolved as soon as possible he said Moon formerly assistant US trade representative for China and second secretary at the US embassy in Beijing said that even if a phaseone deal is reached imminently there are still huge challenges in clinching an overall settlement of the dispute There are now arguably more issues on the table than when it all began One of the biggest problems is that it the issues keeps expanding he said Whether there is a socalled phase one deal before Dec 15 when the US is scheduled to impose new tariffs of 15 percent mainly on Chinese consumer goods is not clear nor is Chinas response if that is the case Since the dispute began in March last year the US has imposed tariffs on US550 billion worth of Chinese products while China has reciprocated with US185 billion worth of tariffs on US goods Despite extensive talks between VicePremier Liu He Chinas chief trade negotiator US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin the US leading negotiators the progress hoped for has not yet been achieved Some argue that without a phase one deal the US could be tipped into recession next year a situation any president would want to avoid in an election year US billionaire bond fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach believes there is a 75 percent chance of this happening if nothing is signed Dan Wang from the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing believes that if the US imposes new tariffs on a range of consumer goods next month as it has warned then this could have a big impact on domestic consumers and damage retail confidence The consumption figures in the US so far have been quite strong but if these new tariffs are imposed I am pretty sure this will make a big difference It will be mostly on electronics such as iPhones and other products she said One of the biggest casualties so far appears to be US manufacturing with the monthly manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management hitting a 10year low in September of 478 percent It rallied slightly to 489 percent in October but this still represented three straight months of contraction  measured at below 50 percent Timothy Fiore chair of the ISMs manufacturing business survey committee said global trade remains the most significant issue for manufacturers Despite the trade dispute Chinese exports overall rose by 49 percent in the first 10 months of this year according to the General Administration of Customs An 113 percent fall in exports to the US was compensated by a rise of 51 percent in those to the European Union and a 104 percent rise to the Association of Southeast Asian nations trading bloc However exports fell last month by 09 percent the third successive monthly drop but below the 39 percent forecast by Bloomberg He Weiwen senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing and a former trade diplomat believes Chinas trade has been resilient in the face of the dispute with the US The US economy has definitely been hit more than Chinas by the conflict Our exports to the European Union and ASEAN members have increased substantially despite those to the US falling he said He a former counselor at the Chinese Consulates General in San Francisco and New York believes China is in a strong negotiating position and should hold out for a fair deal A deal is obviously better than no deal at all but a bad deal is worse than no deal as far as China is concerned he said US farmers have been among those worst affected by the dispute as they have faced Chinese tariffs of up to 33 percent on soybeans and 72 percent on pork Aaron Krauter former head of North Dakotas farm service agency said China used to buy 80 to 90 percent of the areas soybean output Its a huge loss he told Fortune magazine If its soybeans the impact of the trade war is really obvious If its wheat it is kind of obvious If its other oil seed crops like canola theyre saying Wait a minute what happened to our market What happened to our prices On Oct 11 Trump said that China buying up to US50 billion of US agricultural products might be part of any phase one deal On Oct 11 Trump said that China buying up to US50 billion of US agricultural products might be part of any phase one deal Andy Mok research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization a leading independent think tank in Beijing believes US farmers have been the real victims of the dispute The agriculture sector has suffered terribly because of this and it may never recover he said Although Chinas GDP growth slowed to 6 percent in the third quarter most commentators said this had little to do with the trade dispute Wang at the EIU said The main actual slowdown is in infrastructure and property because of Chinas policy decisions making conditions tight Trading partners in the Belt and Road Initiative do not appear to be significantly affected by the dispute Bukola Ogunsina editor of the Sunday edition of the Leadership newspaper in Lagos Nigeria said her country continues to benefit from Chinese investment in vital infrastructure We would only be impacted if there was a global slowdown In terms of trade we are trying to build our own consumer market Our president Muhammadu Buhari has a Made in Nigeria strategy encouraging farmers to grow crops for the domestic market and not rely on imports she said The reasons and causes of the trade dispute are still being debated Some believe it stems from a fear of the US being left behind in the technology race with Chinese companies establishing dominance such as Huawei in 5G mobile communications Mok at CCG said The reaction to this seems sudden but the cause has been there for some time The US sees itself as needing to maintain absolute technological superiority to retain military hegemony However Moon at CMS has a different perspective American firms welcome competition but they want a level playing field Chinas new Foreign Investment Law which was passed in March and will take effect in January will allow more operating room for foreign companies in the Chinese market Wang at the EIU believes the business environment in China has already improved This has been backed up in recent surveys by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China and by AmCham the American Chamber of Commerce in China They talk about a big improvement in terms of the ease of doing business in China The domestic market is more open than before and the timeline for opening up the financial market has been speeded up she said Whether such factors make it easier for a resolution of the trade dispute remains to be seen"

"2019_12";"The Global Economys Luck May Run Outtxt";" This being December my natural inclination is to review the past years economic and financial developments to help policymakers and investors anticipate what might be coming in 2020 This year is ending on a relatively positive note especially when compared to the same time last year There is hope of a global growth pickup trade tensions have lessened and central banks have reaffirmed that that they will maintain ultralow interest rates and continue to provide ample liquidity Financial volatility is subdued and there are reasonable expectations of solid investor returns across many asset classes As tempting as it is to dwell on current financial and macroeconomic conditions doing so risks obfuscating a key element in the outlook for the future There is a curious contrast between the relative clarity of expectations for the near term and the murkiness and uncertainty that comes when one extends the horizon further  say to the next five years Many countries are facing structural uncertainties that could have farreaching systemic implications for markets and the global economy For example over the next five years the European Union will seek to establish a new working relationship with the United Kingdom while also dealing with the harmful social and political effects of slow insufficiently inclusive growth The EU will have to navigate the perils of a prolonged period of negative interest rates while also shoring up its economic and financial core As long as the eurozones architecture is incomplete consistent risks of instability will remain Moreover in the years ahead the United States having notably outperformed many other economies will decide whether to continue disengaging from the rest of the world  a process that is at odds with its historic position at the center of the global economy Or consider Chinas development process With the global economy acting more as a drag on growth than a boon to it China may confront the risk that it has overplayed its hand Heavy reliance on shortterm stimulus measures is increasingly inconsistent with pursuing the longerterm reforms that it needs and its geopolitical ambitions and regional economic and financial commitments including the Belt and Road Initiative are becoming costlier Most important in the next five years China and the US the worlds two largest national economies will have to navigate an increasingly narrow path as they try to secure their own interests while avoiding an outright confrontation Such fluidity clouds the economic financial institutional political andor social outlook for other countries Todays macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties will amplify those fueled by technological disruptions climate change and demographics And they will raise questions about the functioning and resilience of the global economy and markets This degree of uncertainty is particularly notable in the multidecade context of globalization In recent years the stability that comes with broadbased adherence to the rulesbased international order has been considerably weakened as has the power of central banks to repress financial volatility and buy time for the real economy Left unmanaged these mediumterm structural trends would set the stage for greater political and social fragmentation and raise the specter of secular deglobalization If there is one thing that neither the global economy nor markets are wired for it is a prolonged and deepening rupture in crossborder economic and financial relations Were such a new paradigm to materialize todays trade investment and currency tensions would intensify and spill over to the realm of national security and geopolitics Bad outcomes are not inevitable at least not yet They could still be averted through the sustained implementation of policies to promote stronger more inclusive growth restore genuine financial stability and usher in a fairer more credible while still free system of international trade investment and policy coordination But much will depend on the functioning of politics in the near term Going into 2020 politicians have a favorable runway from which to launch the policies needed to extend the positive shortterm outlook into the medium and long term Worries about global recession have receded financial conditions are ultraaccommodating and USChina trade tensions have deescalated But these auspicious circumstances will not last forever Unfortunately a policy push that could improve and clarify the mediumterm outlook is unlikely The US is entering a tense and divisive election year Germany Italy and Spain are in the midst of difficult political transitions The EU is dealing with Brexit and other regional divisions And Chinas government is trying to consolidate power in the face of slowing growth and continuing protests in Hong Kong The main worry  one that too few market participants have spotted  is that over the next five years global economic and market conditions may need to deteriorate nearer to crisis levels before national regional and multilateral political systems muster an adequate response Fortunately we are now in a period when action could be taken to prevent the worstcase scenario from becoming a binding reality Let us hope that Im wrong about todays political paralysis As long as there is still time there is a chance that policymakers will follow the advice offered by thenIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde in October 2017 Fix the roof while the sun is shining "

"2020_1";"ECONOMIC VISION  Global Economic Outlooktxt";" In my previous two columns I commented on the outlook I expect for our economy this year and this time I am referring to the outlook for the world economy including Mexico which was published on Monday this week by the International Monetary Fund IMF for 2020 and 2021 Just like last year the IMFs chosen scenario for updating its World Economic Outlook WEO report was the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland The IMF has consistently reduced its growth projections for the global economy since last year Today it estimates that it advanced by 29 percent in 2019 and anticipates an uptick to 33 percent in 2020 and 34 percent in 2021 meaning respective cuts of 01 percentage points pp and 02 pp over last October forecasts These cuts are mainly due to unexpected lyorned results in some emerging economies India in particular and also the impact of the greatest social unrest in several countries around the world during 2019 such as Chile  Expected growth for advanced economies in 2020 also slowed by 01 pp and kept it unchanged by 2021 On the plus side markets have been spurred by signs that manufacturing and international trade are approaching a tipping point by a general reorientation towards accommodative monetary policy news on the USChina trade negotiations as well as the diminishing fears of a traumatic separation between the UK and the European Union For the US economy the worlds most important and most relevant to us the WEO report anticipates that as it grew 23 percent in 2019 it would drop to 2 percent this year a reduction of 01 pp from the October forecast  and 17 percent in 2021 This behavior reflects the return to a neutral fiscal stance and the everdesshed momentum of monetary easing Regarding our economy the IMF now believes that there was a stalemate in 2019 and that in 2020 the recovery would be 1 accelerated in 2021 to just 16 representing a 03 pp cut in growth for this year and next to the p October revisions due among other reasons to the continued weakness in investment These WEO forecasts contradict the official Mexican estimates Indeed the Ministry of Finance in the General Economic Policy Criteria of September last year anticipated oneoff growth of 2 and 23 per cent respectively by 2020 and 2021 The intervals were 15 to 25 percent in 2020 and 18 to 28 percent As can be seen IMF forecasts do not even reach the lower limit of both intervals On the other hand the WEO figures if materialized would mean that the growth in the first half of the current sixyear was 09 per cent per annum so to reach the average 4 per cent promised by the administration to the entire sixyear year course there would have to be average growth in the order of 7 percent in the second half which is impossible with any kind of economic policy except the current one It is clear therefore that the possibility of our economy growing above 2 in the coming years is becoming increasingly remote This is due both to the Governments reluctance to balance the direction of its economic policy and because the US economy will continue to weaken and as the IMF points out downside risks to global growth remain significant including exacerbation of geopolitical tensions particularly the US tensions with Iran increased social unrest and a deepening ofeconomic frictions between countries 861 days to go  sakalifaagmailcom         "
"2020_1";"Global economic confidence bounces back in Q4txt";" NEW YORK and MONTVALE NJ  The latest Global Economic Conditions Survey GECS released from ACCA the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and IMA Institute of Management Accountants has found that global economic confidence bounced back in Q4 2019 to around its level in mid2019 with a particularly strong improvement in North America While the global poll of 2560 accountants reported a recovery in economic confidence in all key regions it also found that global confidence is below its longrun average and forecast continued modest expansion in the world economy in early 2020 GECS is the largest regular economic survey of accountants around the world in terms of both the number of respondents and the range of economic variables it monitors Overall the report noted that the global orders index which is less volatile than confidence was little changed for the third quarter in a row and global investment and employment indices also were relatively stable in Q4 close to longrun averages The global inflation picture continues to point to subdued cost pressures reflecting the effects of a slowdown in economic growth Head of ACCA USA Warner Johnston said In 2019 the global economy expanded at close to 3 the slowest rate since the financial crisis ten years ago The GECS foreshadowed this slowdown which continued steadily throughout last year Looking ahead the GECS points to steady growth early this year with no strong pick up but no global recession either Many risks to the global economy in 2020 are the same as in 2019 IMA vice president of research and policy Raef Lawson PhD  CMA CPA added There are downside risks to the economy the main one being a reescalation of USChina trade tensions But on the upside last years monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve and many other central banks will support growth in coming months It is also a year in which we are encountering a US presidential election which often coincides with a buoyant economy A global recession is very unlikely but it will be another year of sluggish growth The US GECS confidence measure improved significantly in Q4 to its highest level since 2018 Q2 Progress in the trade negotiations with China and the third  percentage point cut in the US Federal Funds rate since July are likely to have been factors in improved sentiment  "

"2020_1";"Oil Market Takes Wary Approach to Virus Scaretxt";" Run for cover ask questions later That sums up the oil markets prevailing sentiment amid a wave of infections caused by a new coronavirus that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan Despite a general sense that talk of a global economic slowdown and a slump in oil demand is probably overblown Brent crude futures fell about 6 per barrel over the last week or so and West Texas Intermediate futures about 5bbl Global stock markets also took a hit during recent sessions Its unclear whether prices will fall any further after their recent slide and prices did seem to be stabilizing by Tuesday with Brent futures ticking up slightly to settle just below 60bbl Earlier in the week Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman described the sharp fall in prices as psychological urging caution against excessive gloom and bearishness  IOD Jan2820  In fact there had already been a loose consensus among analysts that global equity markets were poised for a correction so the scary new virus provided a timely pretext to sell riskier assets like stocks which had attained lofty valuations There were also hopes that investors willing to take a longterm view would return to the long side of the market and bet on higher prices once a 10 pullback was reached although this has not materialized yet The spread of the virus in China and beyond took a toll on market sentiment China has been a key driver of growth in global oil demand and a major epidemic could hit the countrys economy limit travel and dampen oil demand On the other hand financial analysts have drawn comparisons with the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sars in 2003 which turned out to be shortlived Translating the estimated Sars demand impact into 2020 volumes points to a potential 260000 barrel per day yearonyear loss of global oil demand including 170000 bd of jet fuel demand Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients Barclays said the adverse effect on global oil consumption could result in a 2bbl drop in oil prices However the Sars outbreak may not provide much useful guidance Chinas economy is much bigger today than it was in 2003 driven more by domestic consumer demand and more reliant on public transportation and air travel The risk of a slowdown in Chinas GDP growth  recently estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 6 in 2020  comes amid prior expectations that global oil supply will exceed demand in the first half of this year For now the Asian jet fuel market faces the most immediate pressure with travel restrictions in China resulting in flight cancellations and fewer departures from Chinas largest airports Barclays estimates that if air passenger traffic in China were to decline by half in first quarter of 2020 it would likely lead to a 300000 bd yearonyear decline in jet kerosene demand from China On the crude side a bullish cocktail of supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria have barely helped support prices recently despite taking at least 1 million bd out of the market  IOD Jan2820  The recent dump just makes me wonder how much lower prices would be without the Libyan and Nigeria outages PVM analyst Tamas Varga told Energy Intelligence And with the call on Opec crude at least 600000 bd below the groups projected production in the first half of 2020 deeper cuts in output may be warranted if a worstcase scenario were to play out in China Depending on the pace and extent of the further spread of coronavirus infections the efficacy of containment strategies is likely to play a crucial role in shaping market sentiment in the coming days and weeks "

"2020_3";"A Global Economy Infectedtxt";" A Times reporter who follows the Federal Reserve discusses the coronaviruss impact on the worlds finances Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behindthescenes insights into how our journalism comes together    As the coronavirus tears across the world factories are idling stores are closing and supply chains are breaking bringing the global economy to a crawl with repercussions that are still unfolding Major cities countries and central banks are taking measures to curb the outbreak and ease the financial strain but to what effect In a world of rising nationalism such a universal crisis of health and finances points to nations interdependence In Mondays Times Insider the reporter Matt Phillips talked in an interview about the volatility in the US stock market Below is a conversation with Jeanna Smialek who covers the Federal Reserve from Washington She discussed the pandemics impact on the worlds wallet   How big of a hit was the plummeting of the US stock market on the global economy   The way to understand this is less about asking What do stock declines mean for the global economy but rather What does the global economy mean for stocks At no point in the modern economic era  in this globalized and heavily financialized world  have we seen something bring so many countries to a grinding halt simultaneously   On Sunday the Fed slashed interest rates to almost zero How could that affect us going forward   The move should help consumers borrow and spend For example it should make mortgages cheaper But at the end of the day nothing the Fed can do at this point is going to offset the full shock of coronavirus because its tools are just not wellsuited to making up for lost work hours or helping employees who have missed out on paychecks They can do a few things to make sure that companies who are missing out on cash flow right now can get loans but even then they cannot force banks to lend to insolvent businesses that are bad bets The Fed will never say its out of ammunition because that is not in its DNA as an institution but there is a lot of room for congressional action right now   How has the closure of Italy affected the global economy specifically   Italy is actually a pretty large economy and people dont appreciate that But what happened is you saw a bunch of things going bad all at one time Italy closed cases in Germany jumped cases in America began ticking up cruise ships were lighting up with infections All of those things together created a perfect storm that showed investors that this wasnt going to be a blip on the radar   Can nations work together to help the global economy rebound   One big story that the coronavirus has brought to light is that global central banks do not have the firefighting power that they had going into the 2008 financial crisis Many central banks like in Japan and in parts of Europe already had very low or even negative interest rates And so they just have less room to act to soften the economic blow   What matters right now is what happens to the companies getting clobbered in the moment What does it mean for airlines cruise lines hotels Is this a shortterm blip that is painful but not devastating Or will this kill companies thereby having greater repercussions for financial markets and be much more longlived in its pain   How does this pandemic compare to the influence of other major events   This is almost entirely unprecedented People try to compare this to SARS but its bigger And then people try to compare this to 911 but most people didnt have to work from home for a month because of 911 People kept going to restaurants after 911 It didnt have the same quarantining effect which is really important here   At the end of the day the government cant get people back to restaurants when its not perceived to be safe to go to them Thats not something anyone can fix  whether youre the US government or the central bank   Can you and your editors prepare for this type of coverage   It really changes on an hourly basis You could prepare to cover Brexit or the Trump election or any of those big economic moments but here you just dont know whats going to crumble first or whats going to experience problems next so you just have to stay in touch with all of your sources and keep up to the moment   What is a typical day like for you right now   Nothing like normal Im working from home and Ive worked pretty much every day since the middle of February Im camped out in my studio apartment which looks like a war room I have all the financial crisis books opened up to important pages and strewn across the floor notes tacked up on the walls The news breaks so fast its just a very different pace and reality   Usually at The Times we step back and write the capital I important stories Now everything is suddenly capital I important so Im writing several stories a day and we have a live briefing that constantly updates   If theres one takeaway for readers on the global economy what should it be   Its been said by every person on the planet at this point but the single best thing for the global economy is for this virus to be contained More than any fiscal or monetary package the public health response here is most important   The other thing to realize is this is going to be painful but it should be temporary As long as it doesnt precipitate a financial crisis things should calm down but there is just epic uncertainty about when that comes a couple of months a year or 18 months  "

hoping to resell at a later date when prices go up Traders said reasonable storage fees of around 70 centsb to 90 centsb could incentivise them to keep the cheaper jet barrels in tanks until a time when jet fuel prices picks up  This comes as the jet fuel market has deepened in steep contango as a result of the coronavirus pandemic Most importantly there is simply nowhere for jet fuel cargoes to

Reuters during 713 February expected Chinas economic growth to slump to 45 in the first quarter of 2020 down from 6 in the previous quarter the slowest since the financial crisis Meanwhile Chinas

accounts for 191 of global GDP using purchasing power parity PPP or 17 at current exchange rates 13 of global trade and 28 of global manufacturing output in 2018 Impact on developing economies Developing countries especially those dependent on commodity exports and global supply chains are particularly vulnerable The impact is expected to be more severe for the 21 African countries the IMF sees as resourceintensive where growth had already slowed to about 25 Trade between Africa and China grew 22 in 2019 to US2087bn compared with a 20 rise the year before Even Latin America counts China

countries linked to China through supply chains raw material exports investment and tourism are especially vulnerable while other Asian giants Japan and South Korea have also been hit by the virus Global supply chain disruptions The virtual shutdown of the factory of the world has slowed the supply of products and parts from China disrupting production the world over Apples manufacturing partner in China Foxconn is experiencing production delays while a Lombardy electronics factory was forced to close by the Italian authorities due to an outbreak Some carmakers including Nissan and

"2020_3";"COVID19 impact on global economiestxt";" Link to Story After more than 60 days of the outbreak of a new coronavirus known as COVID19 the world had been discovering new ways in China and its health system that remarkably managed to impose quarantine on whole cities within days to cease the spread of this disease The day China announced some COVID19 cases the Chinese authorities began building specialised hospitals that were completed in less than 10 days and the Chinese media promoted some snapshots of the construction that lasted day and night to show the Chinese power and to restore the Chinese peoples confidence in their governmentMany experts believe that one of the unexpected events that has caused turmoil in the global economy since the beginning of this year has been the emergence of coronavirus Several warnings issued by international economic and financial institutions have revealed negative economic impacts due to the outbreak of the coronavirus around the world which will affect the world economies for at least 2020 The warnings came due to lower global consumption with less global spending as the Chinese products constitute more than 65 per cent of the world production This has resulted in reduction of air trips and tourism activities since the beginning of January with estimated losses of airline companies to amount to 25 billion  The rise in the number of coronavirus infections in addition to the constant increase in death cases had lowered the expectations of Chinese and global economic growth in 2020These cuts of global economic growth have ranged from 04 per cent to 15 per cent In other words this percentage stands for a decrease in global GDP by 400 billion to 1 trillion in the first half of 2020 The negative economic forecasts are linked to several factors the most important of which are the lack of data and concrete information about the exact cases of COVID19 and the suitable treatment as well as the cost of each patient on the national and international economies The outbreak of coronavirus was considered a global crisis However the most affected country is China whose economy outlook has been downgraded to 52 per cent from 6 per cent in 2020 The spread of the virus coincides with the current fragility of the global economy which will mean double trouble for many countries including the developed ones Some financial experts said the impact of the global epidemic will be multiplied and exemplified by the occurrence of major disruptions in the supply chain and a steady decline in investor confidenceThe spread of the new coronavirus has challenged governments and health authorities after the World Health Organisation declared a state of emergency to prevent and control this disease The declaration of a state of emergency aims to coordinate efforts and strengthen international cooperation to maintain global health securityIt is difficult to quantify the total value of losses and determine the size of the final impact of this virus on both the Chinese and global levels In 2003 the SARS epidemic made headlines and the number of deaths reached 800 which led to widespread unrest in China Then Chinas GDP growth decreased temporarily in 2003 to 91 per cent at the peak of the SARS epidemic Moreover global growth lost about one percentage point due to decline of economic growth of China Yet by the end of the year it was about three points higher than before the outbreak of SARS Fear of infection is the main reason for the decline in retail and travel sales because people avoid crowded placesShares in the Chinese market fell by 14 per cent on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges posing a challenge for investors and companies to survive or escape Some economic analysts believe that China had benefited from the decline by buying investor shares at low pricesOil prices were negatively affected by a decrease of 23 per cent during the February 2020 trading before rebounding upward due to talks about the possibility of new production cuts by OPEC Because of the decrease in Chinese consumption by million barrels per day in addition to demand decline for jet fuel due to the disruption of global travel activities the world economy is expecting further economic and financial issues and slower growth China which is the second largest oil importer in the world has injected hundreds of billions into Chinese financial markets to provide liquidity and stimulate markets and the Peoples Bank of China reduced the general interest rate on loans to 405 per cent Since many factories have been shut down in China in the past two weeks the direct effect is not on the Chinese alone but it extends far beyond Chinas borders since many international companies have their industries and factories in Chinese cities due to cheap labour including Apple and Nissan Therefore the shortage of products and spare parts from the Chinese market will affect many countries around the world and the longer this virus remains unleashed the more slowdown of world economies leading to further economic financial security and military ramifications"

economic policy measures taken by China the US and other countries unless there is timely global cooperation and coordination What will be the global economic impact of COVID19 if swift and effective action is not taken globally Is there a way to find out through some kind of rigorous modelbased economic analysis Indeed there may be a sober realitybased way of looking at the possible economic consequences In work that is still ongoing I have used the best available data from the World Bank the IMF and other national and international sources about the Global Economy to do precisely this exercise My preliminary results pertain to the overall effects for the World economy China the US the Middle East as well as for specific sectors More importantly they also give us some rough insights

employment losses are estimated from several models for several scenarios These are both the containment costs and costs stemming from global panic with higher and lower bounds and an inbetween

will Japan the Middle East the US and EU economies along with many other smaller economies Hence there is no reason for the rivals of China to rejoiceWith maximal containment costs and panic Chinese GDP will decline by several percentage points EU will lose about two percentage points and US about between one and one and a half per centBut some of the model results already at hand should give thoughtful ME US and EU citizens pause With declining oil prices the oil producing economies are already experiencing economic downturns The direct and indirect effects of COVID19 will worsen this trend As a first approximation my current modeling results show that the easing of monetary policy and implementing expansionary fiscal policieseven if they are imposed immediately and coordinated globally will take about six months to kick in and will lead towards the very low loss scenario especially for China But for EU and the US financial firms the loss will be considerably more than what we have seen so far The corresponding loss in global employment in these and other sectors should also give all countries pause While medical and public health professionals struggle to understand the nature of the virus and devise antidotes strong economic measures need to taken globally and within countries to protect vulnerable groups A coordinated interest rate cut will most probably happen but monetary policy can not by itself help increase global investment and output Tax cuts will help but will take time even if they are wisely designed to help not just the global rich but the middle class and the low income groups Fiscal policies through direct government expenditures targeted to specific sectors and groups will be necessary Furthermore trade policies are important too If trade barriers go up because of this panic reinforcing earlier hostilities then all countries will be losers The hostilities against China may well be heading in that direction Likewise some countries might try to counteract the loss in exports by devaluing their currencies Such moves can rapidly expand through the international system creating a competitive devaluations scenario where no one will ultimately win Consider also the role that trading networks have always played Clearly with globalization these networks of firms across the globe are even more important than before With a large scale disruption the dynamics of network trade may easily break down Since networks require time to build up again such large scale disruptions will result in longer term malfunction of the global trading system The world leaders must act quickly and resolutely before it is too late We are facing the possibility of a vicious downward cycle in the global economy Single countries can act and indeed have acted unilaterally for example the US by cutting interest rates citing an emergency situation But global coordination of monetary fiscal trade and exchange rates policies is sorely needed

"2020_4";"Singapore Jet Trader Hin Leong Succumbs to Saudi Price Wartxt";" The oil price war kicked off by Saudi Arabia last month claimed its first highprofile victim with Singapores Hin Leong Trading crippled by severe financial problems Companies from Singapore and China are lining up to rescue the firm and its shipping arm Ocean Tankers which both filed for bankruptcy on Apr 18 As one of Asias biggest jet fuel traders the integrated market player collapsed under the weight of financing problems massive losses limited hedging and the oil demand collapse from the Covid19 pandemic Singapore state investment company Temasek Holdings jet fueltrading firm China Aviation Oil Singapore CAO and Asias largest refiner Sinopec are rumored to be among the bidders interested in taking a stake in parts of tycoon Oon Kuin Lims empire  Hin Leongs unexpected demise comes as the company revealed it had concealed about 800 million in losses over the years bringing its total liabilities to 405 billion against assets of 714 million as of Apr 9 An affidavit filed with Singapore authorities described tremendous liquidity strain the Saudiinitiated price war had put on Hin Leong and its subsidiaries but conceded this was due partly to its business model Hin Leongs strategy is based on blending products like fuel oil into finished bunkers and storing products like jet fuel fuel oil and others to take advantage of changing market conditions That means it can take up to 60 days from the time Hin Leong pays for a cargo to the time it receives payment when it resells that cargo the affidavit noted The latest bankruptcy filing has raised questions about the strength of Singapores commodity trading industry and the cost banks may have to pay This has forced several Singaporean state bodies to step in assuring that the domestic oiltrading sector remains resilient and that banks are well capitalized The Monetary Authority of Singapore also reminded banks not to derisk indiscriminately from bunkering and oiltrading sectors Hin Leongs plight follows the fall of Hontop Energy the Singaporeheadquartered trading arm of the Wanda Group conglomerate which was placed into receivership and owns a 100000 barrel per day refinery in the city of Dongying in Chinas Shandong province Sinopec is reportedly in early stage talks to buy the 41 interest held by Lim and his family through Universal Group Holdings in Universal Terminal a major Singapore storage site with capacity of 233 million cubic meters The other shareholders are PetroChina 25 and Australian investment bank Macquarie 34 The rationale for Sinopec to make an offer makes sense as the company lacks oil storage in Singapore The firm opened its first overseas petrol station in Singapore in 2018 but does not have a refining presence in the country It would likely have enough funds due to profits from its refining activities according to sources Sinopec has also benefited from Chinese regulations passed in 2016 which stipulate that if oil dips below 40 per barrel domestic product prices will remain steady providing firms with increasingly large margins as oil prices fall   As the dominant importer of jet fuel into China CAOs potential interest in acquiring a stake in Hin Leong would help diversify its trading of oil products and provide access to storage capacity CAO has been leasing storage in Singapore and South Korea A potential rival bidder such as Temasek Holdings has a track record of temporary investments to rescue companies facing financial troubles The company spent 1023 million through its subsidiary Aranda Investments to acquire a 465 stake in CAO after the firm went bankrupt in 2004 under the weight of derivatives trading losses totaling more than 500 million PetroChina could also increase its stake in the terminal The Chinese firm acquired a refining presence in Singapore after the acquisition of a 455 stake in Singapore Petroleum Co in 2009 for 1 billion The immediate effect of Hin Leongs collapse has been the traders inability to participate in the Singapore trading window where it exerted a significant influence on Asian oil product prices The normally active Hin Leong has not been seen in any Platts pricing windows since Apr 9 This has considerably reduced trading liquidity in the window  especially for jet and fuel oil  and is inflating the impact on prices of other market players  JFI Mar2320  In the past Hin Leongs actions would have countered aggressive market moves in one direction or another according to trading sources Hin Leong also supplies products  mainly gasoil and jet  through term contracts to Myanmar and Indonesia and those term supplies are now imperiled by its financial difficulties Market sources suggest Hin Leong will struggle to get letters of credit to facilitate those supplies in the near term The financial problems have also hit its tanker chartering and management company Ocean Tankers which is one of the worlds largest tanker fleet operators and controls more than 150 vessels ranging from coastal barges to very large crude carriers  "
"2020_4";"Sudden Demand Slump to Test Russian Refineriestxt";" Russias massive refinery fleet has entered the most daunting quarter in recent memory From the start of April oil companies are having to slash processing volumes as domestic demand shrivels in the wake of the deadly coronavirus now fanning across the country Adding insult to injury Russia has pledged its Opecplus partners a massive reduction in oil output that will have a significant downstream blowback Together this double whammy will lead to an unprecedented cut in refining runs as spring proceeds manifested by extended turnarounds or outright shutins Pavel Sorokin deputy energy minister said last week that domestic gasoline consumption in large cities has fallen by 40 and diesel by 3035 by midApril as a result of the economic standstill in Russia where the coronavirus has taken hold several weeks later than in the rest of Europe Jet fuel consumption has collapsed by more than 50 he added Annually Russia consumes roughly 80 million metric tons of these three products representing some 28 of all oil products output indicating the degree of adjustments refiners will have to make in AprilJune Data for the first two weeks in April show that refineries curtailed throughput to 752500 tons per day down by 74 compared to the average daily run in March However this cut largely corresponds with the seasonal outages scheduled for April or 29 million tons of primary capacity Feedstock for the month after all has already been purchased and refineries can only store so much Oil deliveries to March interestingly enough clearly show that refineries were oblivious to the coronavirus scare that had begun to bring parts of Europe to a standstill and boosted throughput compared to February  table  May however will be a completely different story and feature extended turnarounds and a slew of unplanned outages As Alexander Shkurin head of market analysis at Refinitiv in Moscow said during a webinar last week the example of China shows that if were at the start of the growth in cutbacks then in all likelihood it will last three months Each refinery will decrease throughput based on a combination of factors  product slate logistic costs shifting tax burden  but sectorwide the cutback should be steep According to one Moscowbased analyst runs could fall a staggering 30 due to falling demand and the oil production cuts If this is extrapolated until the years end annual throughput could plummet to 220 million tons which contrasts to 285 tons in 2019  a number so low it is difficult to fathom But this is a worstcase scenario Throughput reductions will be asymmetrical given Russias geography the coronavirus is spreading unevenly and there is too much refining capacity in the European part of the country Data indicate that Rosneft will reduce runs across most of its fleet given the preponderance of heavy fuel in its slate Production at Ryazan a massive facility feeding the hungry Moscow market with gasoline and jet fuel dropped 24 in Apr 115 compared to daily production in March Throughput at the majors Samara group of refineries plummeted 41 over the same period Right now the biggest headache for Russias refineries is gasoline since typically some 87 of output is sold on the domestic market The spot price for 92octane gasoline fell over 10 in the first two weeks of April to 36000 rubles 480 per ton and taxes gobble up some 72 of that according to Moscowbased ATR When you subtract from the domestic price all the four taxes that you have to pay you wind up with a loss for every ton of gasoline  Right now it makes no sense to sell it domestically said Mikhail Turukalov head of analysis at ATR Little wonder then that refineries are cutting back gasoline production Daily output fell 22 in Apr 115 compared to the average in March to 88500 tons Rather than pay the high taxes it makes more sense for refineries to export separate gasoline components like reformate alkylate and naphtha analysts say For now the government isnt complaining and may even ease quotas for gasoline sales on the St Petersburg exchange Still refineries find themselves with a glut of product and on Apr 17 for instance Rosneft offloaded an unusually large volume of gasoline on the exchange Such behavior could also indicate the lack of storage options for products Curiously two refineries have bucked the trend in April Surgutneftegas 420000 barrel per day Kinef refinery the countrys second largest upped throughput in Apr 115 by 67 compared to March since its enviable logistics and a lower April export duty allow it to eke out a decent margin on its massive heavy fuel oil output Tatnefts Taneco meanwhile ramped up throughput over the same period by 136 Last week the ambitious regional refiner launched an 850000 ton per year hydrotreater for heavy gasoil which will allow it to crank out more lowsulfur bunker fuel and Euro 5grade diesel In the nearterm the task will be to preserve both oil and oil products exports said Turukalov which should have increasingly attractive netbacks due to the steep drop in export duties starting in May as well as a weak ruble Theyll cut production and slash refining even more so that exports decline even less than output Theyll try to maintain fairly large oil product exports to global markets so that foreign currency receipts are restored he said"

"2020_7";"Global economic forecast Grimmer outlooktxt";" Dhaka July 11  Economic uncertainties continue to constrain global economic growth Late last month the International Monetary Fund IMF further downgraded the global economic growth projection  a contraction by 49 per cent in 2020 some 19 percentage point below the April quarter forecast Also the recovery in 2021 would be slower than projected in the April forecast and during the same year Global GDP would be down by 4 per cent relative to its level in 2019 so long as there is no second wave of Covid19 infections The IMF further warned that a cumulative hit to the global economy would be of US12 trillion over 20202021 The IMF further indicated that for the first time ever nearly all regions of the world are expected to experience negative growth in 2020 Emerging markets and developing economies excluding China are expected to take a bigger hit to GDP growth than advanced economies in 202021The growth forecast for this region is to be 3 per cent this year 2 percentage points below the April forecast This is truly a global crisis which translates into a risk of slowing down or even reversing the process of poverty reduction that has been witnessed in recent years It further noted that the steep decline in economic activity had caused catastrophic hit to global labour market and estimates jobloss could be 300 million in the second quarter of this year The impact of the crisis in particular is acutely felt by low skilled workers who do not have the option to work from home According the International Labour Organisation ILO close to 80 per cent of about 2 billion workers in the informal sector have been affected This will negatively impact on lowincome households leading to further significantly widening income inequality The crisis is now exposing existing glaring inequalities The covid19 has affected poorer sections of the population more severely therefore they mostly bear the brunt of economic consequences of the pandemic At the same time these low skilled workers do not have the option to work from home exposing the digital divide at a time when the digitisation process of the global economy is accelerating The report while recognising monetary and fiscal actions have been effective in helping prevent a massive wave of bankruptcies and unemployment but at a huge cost where fiscal actions now amount to about US107 trillion and monetary policy measures amount to over US6 trillion This is a response like no other to a crisis before Of particular concern is the debt financed spending under the current situation but it is a necessary step in the right direction to mitigate the economic consequences of the pandemic Also the latest report issued by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD in June dismissed any possibility of V shaped recovery for developed economies from the consequences of restrictions imposed as a result of Covid19 The OECD covers 33 economies Its Chief economist Laurence Boon commented that economic activity had collapsed across the OECD during the shut down by 20 to 30 per cent in some countries and this was an extraordinary shock Developing economies also have been shaken by falling commodity prices large capital outflows and plummeting remittances It is estimated that migrant remittances have declined by almost a quarter during the pandemic globally Migrant remittances constitute 9 per cent of Bangladesh GDP and most of these remittances come from the US Gulf States the UK and a few other European countries All these countries are now in various stages of lockdown negatively impacting on their economic activity Gulf states in particular are hit by falling oil prices More alarmingly it is estimated that the number of people currently living with acute hunger could double by the end of 2020 raising the fear that the Covid19 pandemic could be turning into a hunger epidemic The OECD report projects two scenarios one in which the virus recedes and remains under control and the other where a second wave erupts later this year Under those circumstances economic activity does not and can not return to normal The report further adds that in a single hit scenario global GDP is projected to decline by 6 per cent this year and in a double hit the contraction will be 71 per cent this year The OECD report also pointed out the hardest hit areas in terms of employment and these include tourism leisure and entertainment But there has been a notable decline in spending on consumer durables investment spending Also trade volume has been contracting These obviously have impact of on the transport sector as reflected in particular in the decline in global air freight traffic There is also increasing disconnect between the real economy and financial markets Equity markets in many instances rallied back close to the prepandemic level exposing this disconnect from the real economy Given the uncertainties about economic outlook resulting from Covid19 investors confidence is shaken With borders closed to stem the spread of the virus also come further restrictions on trade and investment flows This situation will continue until the virus outbreak is contained However government measures around the world have been successful in many countries to flattening the curve of the virus but that also has caused a freeze in economic growth as well as income inequality With rising debt levels both corporate and household and increasing business insolvencies could put the banking system under severe stress feeding into a financial crisis Furthermore preexisting financial weaknesses are also being exposed by the pandemic There is a growing concern shared by financial market analysts that there is potential for a financial crisis emerging unless the Covid19 pandemic crisis is brought under control Given the uncertainty when the economy will operate normally an accommodative monetary policy along with supportive fiscal measures are needed The US Federal Reserve has already signalled to keep interest rates at zero to the end of 2022 The reason for such extraordinary measure which goes far beyond what it did for the Global Financial Crisis GFC of 200708 is to be considered necessary to keep the economy moving Also most countries around the world have introduced a series of fiscal and monetary measures to contain and mitigate the impact of the Covid19 outbreak A developing economy like Bangladesh depends on international trade in goods and services and the flow of investment capital to maintain its growth momentum The current disruption to existing international trade patterns and finance is not only due to the pandemic but also caused by the USChina trade and technology disputes the USEU trade disputes Brexit and tensions arising out of other global geopolitical factors These factors are adversely impacting on business and consumer confidence which can work against achieving desired economic outcomes The economic and social consequences of the pandemic for the impoverished masses in Bangladesh can be quite devastating As of July 9 in Bangladesh 175494 Covid19 cases were reported with 84544 deaths and only 907784 tests were conducted FE July 10 Due to the poor and inadequate healthcare system along with inadequate testing and reporting the scope of the pandemics spread is likely to be much greater than official figures indicate Many analysts apprehend a post Covid19 world that will be poorer and more disorderly More alarmingly they also think that the this will engender a time of instability comparable to the Great Depression leading to the World War II A recent report of the UNICEF indicates that the lives and future of children across South Asia of which Bangladesh is a part are being torn apart The report further adds that due to the pandemic crisis the number of children in poverty could rise by 120 million to more than 360 million within six months in the region These are formidable challenges not only for the South Asian region but also for all developing countries including Bangladesh In this very uncertain global economic and political environment it is very critical that their potential impact on the Bangladesh economy is minimised through sound economic policies and disciplined public finance management In particular debt financed spending should be well targeted and ensured to be transparent and fair In this critical time in the countrys history this will require appropriate fiscal and monetary measures which will help efficient resource allocation investment and productivity gains along with well targeted public spending and a streamlined taxation regime  "

expects COVID19 to put health resilience in the spotlight in 2020 Government responses to COVID19 are expected to significantly lower global economic resilience this year The world index value drops to 05 in the initial estimate for 2020 which aims to capture the impact of the fiscal and monetary stimulus in response to COVID19 on economic resilience While such stimulus packages have cushioned the blow to the global economy they have run down many countries fiscal and monetary reserves causing their resilience scores to fall including drops of more than half in some economies the ERI found The research finds that monetary policy buffers will be largely exhausted in most advanced economies leaving fiscal headroom as the major determinant of resilience Of the countries in the top half of

unchanged primarily because a swift response enabled it to reopen its economy earlier than many others In contrast Switzerland Finland and Canada are anticipated to remain the worlds three most resilient economies The fiscal and monetary stimulus response to COVID19 was key to cushioning the economic impact of governmentordered lockdowns Jerome Jean Haegeli group chief economist at Swiss Re said However the reality of wartimelike spending is that it leaves much less room for future policy manoeuvre He said the key economic policy risk is that these temporary government measures become permanent leaving economies dependent on ongoing stimulus A focus on replenishing resilience by reinstating fiscal and monetary buffers through structural reforms to improve longterm growth prospects will be critical he added Insurance Resilience Insurance resilience against three major risks  mortality health spending and natural catastrophes  weakened in 2019 the indices show The combined global protection gap for the three perils is calculated as reaching a new high of USD 124 trillion Globally mortality resilience declined the most driven by a widening of the mortality protection gap in the AsiaPacific region where Chinas protection gap expanded due to rapidly growing household debt Health resilience was stable despite some deterioration in emerging markets The global health protection gap widened by more than 5 to USD 588 billion Natural catastrophe resilience was lowest of the three risk areas Swiss Re Institute expects that health and mortality protection gaps will widen as households grapple with lower incomes higher healthcare costs and the financial consequences of losing a breadwinner as a result of the pandemic The widening global protection gap is a huge opportunity for insurers to fulfill their mandate as risk absorbers and improve societal resilience Haegeli said In times of crisis households need risk protection Insurance is a key tool to help households reduce their financial vulnerability in disruptive environments Swiss Re Institute launched its Macroeconomic Resilience Index last year ranking countries with respect to a broad spectrum

"2020_8";"Global economy unlikely to benefit from falling dollartxt";" A declining dollar usually boosts trade and the resilience of the global economy and helps to reduce trade imbalances  but its drop since the start of the pandemic crisis is unlikely to do so This is in part because the particular confluence of global currency movements has created winners and losers and also because the spread of the virus itself is hindering the ability of economies to adjust  Since the start of June the dollar has undergone a sudden reversal in popularity among investors who have shifted from viewing it as the global haven to an unfashionable bet The dollar index has fallen more than 9 per cent since its crisisinduced peak in March Reasons for holding dollars have dwindled rapidly according to many currency analysts  US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have eroded the differential between the US and other developed economies as part of its response to the Covid19 crisis  Meanwhile the US governments failure to keep coronavirus under control as effectively as leading European and Asian governments and EU leaders  750bn European Recovery Fund to rebuild the continents economy after the pandemic has fuelled an upswing in confidence about the outlook for the eurozone and the euro The dollar has transitioned into a bear market Its not going to happen in the next few weeks but in over the course of the next five years we think that the dollar could weaken as much as 15 to 20 per cent against a basket of its peers said Aaron Hurd a senior portfolio manager at State Street Global Advisors  Analysts at JPMorgan said Relative growth rather than higher US rates is likely to be the dominant driver of the dollar    High infections in the US    and the political landscape is still likely to be a net drag on the dollar  Among advanced economies the fall in the dollar is likely to have beneficial global effects  so long as it does not develop into a rout For decades the US has run persistent deficits in trade and on its current account and a weaker currency improves the competitiveness of US exports while making imports from other advanced economies more expensive  Alongside any boost to domestic demand that the EUs recovery fund can generate the net effect should be a more balanced global economy at a higher level of demand although the effects might not be large if the US continues to have more access to cheap finance than others But not every part of the global economy is experiencing the dollars decline  The dollar index measures the value of the US currency against a basket of advanced economy currencies dominated by the euro The eurozones currency accounts for 576 per cent of the weight in the currency basket and is joined by the yen sterling the Canadian dollar the Swedish krona and the Swiss franc But the index does not include any emerging economies currencies and the greenback has gained in value against most of them since the pandemic first emerged The dollar has gained nearly 25 per cent against the Brazilian real since March while it is more than 10 per cent stronger against the Mexican peso and the Russian rouble And it is these currency movements that threaten to undermine the global economys prospects  Traditional economics would predict that the currencies of most emerging economies would benefit from weakening against the dollar because it would deliver a boost in demand both by making their exports more competitive and raising the price of imports  But a growing number of economists fear that this argument is wrong  Emerging and developing economies trade is largely priced in US dollars so their exports do not get more competitive when their currencies weaken This means the demand boost is much weaker influential research by the IMF recently suggested And because imports from other emerging economies are also priced in dollars overall trade is hit rather than just imports from the US  This effect has been compounded by coronavirus The biggest export that is priced in domestic currency  tourism  has been hard hit by travel restrictions and is suffering much more than it normally does when emerging currencies weaken  Governments and companies in emerging economies that have borrowed in dollars are at the sharp end of this crisis because they need higher domestic revenues to finance existing borrowings  The IMF argues that this combination is likely to be toxic for the global economy The strengthening of the dollar against emerging and developing economies is likely to amplify the shortterm fall in global trade and economic activity IMF analysts concluded  Even economies that have benefited from the pandemicinduced currency movements are unlikely to benefit much said Stephen King senior adviser to HSBC  Having a rising currency against the dollar would remove a little bit of the emerging market funding pressure but not enough to offset the effects of the pandemic and a loss of fiscal firepower he said  Letter in response to this article  Covid19 poses more of a threat than the weak dollar  From Steven E Cerier Forest Hills NY US  "

"2020_9";"Global economic recovery has slowedtxt";" Bloomberg  The best is over for a global economic recovery that started with energy and is now becoming a great effort Thats Wall Street economists warning to the last months of a traumatic year Nearly 20 trillion of stimulus from governments and central banks has taken the worlds economies back to prepandemic levels But for multiple reasons the last leg will be the hardest Policymakers could reduce fiscal support that has been key to recovery as they have already done in the United States Temporary job cuts could become permanent an aggravated concern this week when corporate giants Walt Disney Co and Royal Dutch Shell Plc fired tens of thousands of workers Moreover the virus itself is spreading faster and forces governments to reimpose blockades as cold weather arrives We are passing the phase in which we recovered from the closure said Ethan Harris director of global economic research at Bank of America Corp at Bloomberg Television All of these risks have made investors less optimistic than they have been since the early weeks of the coronavirus crisis The SP 500 index fell in September after five consecutive monthly advances and Europes Stoxx 600 also cut profits The good news is that the global economy proved more resilient in a global health crisis than many feared thanks to rapid political response Governments subsidized revenue and helped companies stay afloat while central banks cut interest rates and ensured that stressed financial markets remained liquid Deutsche Bank AG which in May warned of a 59 drop in world GDP this year now estimates that the contraction will be limited to 39 Austerity again But that would still amount to the deepest depression in generations And it is unclear how much more governments are willing to borrow and spend to complete the recovery Fiscal stimulus added 37 percentage points of growth to global GDP this year according to JPMorgan Chase Co But the banks economists expect policymakers to repeat the mistakes they made after the 2008 financial crisis and pivot prematurely toward austerity which would turn this years momentum into a 24point fiscal drag next year In the US economists have been cutting fourthquarter growth forecasts because they fear that efforts to pass another coronavirus spending bill have stagnated in Congress although reaching an agreement is still possible before the November presidential election In Europe where the virus prompted leaders to overcome deep disagreements over the pooling of their budgetary resources they now face potential delays in a historic recovery fund of 18 trillion euros US21 trillion which is considered crucial for struggling countries such as Italy and Spain Another factor that holds back hopes for a Vshaped recovery is the accelerated spread of the virus and the absence of a vaccine Governments are reluctant to return to full blockade aware of the devastation it could cause in business But many parts of Europe including the UK have reimposed some restrictions With their incomes reduced companies may have trouble paying off their debts causing more bankruptcies and making lenders more reluctant to lend even to viable companiesThe longer social estating schemes exist the more likely it is for companies to decide that falling demand for their goods or services is a permanent not temporary phenomenon and therefore reduce their workforce Thats already happening in several industries In recent days Disney announced redundancy plans for 28000 workers and Shell said it could cut up to 9000 jobs Continental AG Germany approved a restructuring plan that will eliminate or displace 30000 jobs worldwide As some job losses from the pandemic become permanent the recovery in labor markets is slowing In the US applications for unemployment benefits remain high at about four times last years levels and a key friday report will likely show that payroll growth declined in September Some countries are at least seeing encouraging data on the virus especially China where the disease first spread The worlds secondlargest economy has managed to control the pandemic and move forward on the path of recovery compared to most of its peers even if several indicators suggest it is starting to stabilize But there are other risks besides the pandemic global economy Business confidence depends on geopolitical whims as the US prepares for its elections and trade tensions with China continue to simmer The UKs trade negotiations with the European Union are changing and a tough brexit remains a risk"

"2020_10";"Brexit and the global economytxt";" Link to Story WASHINGTON DC  The singular issue of Brexit has consumed the United Kingdom for two and a half years The if how and when of the countrys withdrawal from the European Union after decades of membership has understandably dominated news coverage and sidelined almost every other policy debate Lost in the mix for example has been any serious discussion of how the UK should boost productivity and competitiveness at a time of global economic and financial fluidityAt the same time the rest of the worlds interest in Brexit has understandably waned The UKs negotiations with the EU have dragged on through multiple déjà vu moments and the consensus is that the economic fallout will be felt far more acutely in Britain than in the EU let alone in countries elsewhereStill the rest of the world is facing profound challenges of its own  Political and economic systems are undergoing farreaching structural changes many of them driven by technology trade climate change high inequality and mounting political anger In addressing these issues policymakers around the world would do well to heed the lessons of the UKs Brexit experienceWhen Britons voted by a margin of 519 per cent to 481 per cent to leave the EU the decision came as a shock to experts pundits and Conservative and Labour Party leaders alike They had underappreciated the role of identity as a driving force behind the June 2016 referendum But now voters deeply held ideas about identity whether real or perceived can no longer be dismissed Though todays disruptive politics are fuelled by economic disappointment and frustration identity is the tip of the spear It has exposed and deepened political and social divisions that are as uncomfortable as they are intractableExperts also predicted that the UK economy would suffer an immediate and significant fall in output following the 2016 referendum In the event they misunderstood the dynamics of what economists call a sudden stop that is abrupt catastrophic dysfunction in a key sector of the economy A perfect example is the 2008 global financial crisis when financial markets seized up as a result of operational dislocations and a loss of mutual confidence in the payments and settlement systemBrexit was different Because you cannot replace something with nothing there was no immediate break in BritishEU trade In the absence of clarity on what type of Brexit would ultimately materialise the economic relationship simply continued as is and an immediate disruption was avertedIt turns out that when making macroeconomic and market projections for Brexit so far short versus long has been more important than soft versus hard  with hard referring to the UKs full and most likely disorderly withdrawal from the European single market and customs union The question is not whether the UK will face a considerable economic reckoning but whenNonetheless the UK economy is already experiencing slowmoving structural change There is evidence of falling foreign investment and this is contributing to the economys disappointing level of investment overall Moreover this trend is accentuating the challenges associated with weak productivity growthThere are also signs that companies with UKbased operations have begun to trigger their Brexit contingency plans after a prolonged period of waiting planning and more waiting In addition to shifting investments out of the UK firms will also start to relocate jobs And this process will likely accelerate even if British Prime Minister Theresa May manages to get her proposed exit deal through parliamentThe Brexit process thus showcases the risks associated with economic and political fragmentation and provides a preview of what awaits an increasingly fractured global economy if this continues namely less efficient economic interactions less resilience more complicated crossborder financial flows and less agility In this context costly selfinsurance will come to replace some of the current systems pooledinsurance mechanisms And it will be much harder to maintain global norms and standards let alone pursue international policy harmonisation and coordinationTax and regulatory arbitrage are likely to become increasingly common as well Economic policymaking will become a tool for addressing national security concerns real or imagined How this approach will affect existing geopolitical and military arrangements remains to be seenLastly there will also be a change in how countries seek to structure their economies In the past Britain and other countries prided themselves as small open economies that could leverage their domestic advantages through shrewd and efficient links with Europe and the rest of the world But now being a large and relatively closed economy might start to seem more attractive And for countries that do not have that option such as smaller economies in east Asia tightly knit regional blocs might provide a serviceable alternativeThe messiness of British party politics has made the Brexit process look like a domestic dispute that is sometimes inscrutable to the rest of the world But Brexit holds important lessons for and about the global economy Gone are the days when accelerating economic and financial globalisation and correlated growth patterns went almost unquestioned We are also in an era of considerable technological and political fluidity The outlooks for growth and liquidity will likely become even more uncertain and divergent than they already are "

"2020_11";"The balance of global economic powertxt";" Alazar Kebede The composition of global growth and wealth has changed dramatically since the 1990s It is true that Chinas economic transformation and sustainable fast development is phenomenal It enabled her to emerge as the second largest economy in the world With its rate of development many predict China to overtake the United States as the number one world economy in the coming ten years This ever growing economic prominence enabled China to have greater political and economic leverage in the current global political and economic operations However the reality is that while countries like China India and Brazil will soon have the largest economies in the world living standards have a long way to go before they catch up with those in Europe the United States and Japan According to the World Bank and OECD recent study reports only 31 per cent of people in Latin America and 13 per cent of people in Asia are part of the global middle class The facts on the ground revealed that the emerging economies are catching up but doing so more slowly than is often realized What this shift implies is that unlike the two previous waves of globalization which are dominated in turn by Britain and United States the current third wave is not characterized by one underpinning economic paradigm or a single dominant country although the rise of Asia will loom large Indeed the world is becoming increasingly diverse in its approaches to economic policies However this growing interest to test new policy responses needs to be anchored by a commitment to a set of basic principles shared between the developed and emerging economies to ensure that it does not erode global cooperation and a sense of a shared global interest In the current wave of globalization and changing balance of economic power the institutions that provide the glue of rulesbased multilateralism need to undergo a process of adaptation based on a simple principle They need to broaden their governance to take in and reflect new states and their growth paths widen the scope of their intellectual and empirical frameworks and ensure at all costs that they remain relevant to the emerging powers which are redefining the global economy This high road in turn requires collaboration and partnership between nation states and an urgency of decisionmaking which manages shortterm needs in the longterm global interest The crucial issue here is what are the possible ways to achieve the above mentioned goals In the current global economy people particularly in the developed world are understandably concerned about whether this third wave of globalization is essentially in their interests They fear that as the East emerges the West will become submerged However as they grow these economies create new markets for highvalue goods and services from the West Notable European economic analysts argued that the challenge for developed countries particularly to Europe is to transform their people from consumer to producer to be smarter and more specialized more innovative and more energetic if they want to secure their share of the worlds rising demand There is little doubt that globalization through its positive impact on growth is contributing to the increased demand for commodities and creating resource constraints particularly of food and water Increased international trade in goods can also contribute to climate change through increases in shipping and aviation But the spread of ideas and technologies can also help solve these problems The answer is not to dismantle globalization but to make growth itself sustainable However understanding that there is a potentially more benign path ahead does not guarantee that it will be followed Narrow growth strategies focused entirely on exports will entrench existing global imbalances and prevent advances in living standards in developing countries from being shared equitably According to Professor Daren Fletcher of Leeds University there is a need to distinguish between healthy tax competition and competition that undermines the revenue mix needed to support national finances pushing the burden unfairly and counterproductively on to personal and consumer taxpayers and giving international companies an advantage over domestic firms There has been an increase in protectionist measures public support for trade in a number of countries notably the United States has fallen dramatically and the WTOs Doha trade round has stalled Since in the last few years multilateralism has had few successes WTO negotiations subsequent G20 meetings and most climate change negotiations have ended in relative disappointment Reforms are clearly needed to increase the legitimacy and effectiveness of the worlds international institutions Weather they are developed or developing individual governments need to be active in helping to equip businesses and individuals to prosper in the global economy If they do not take on this role globalization will only benefit the few not the many and this will fuel a public backlash and potentially a resurgence of nationalism and protectionism For developing countries like Ethiopia there should be a need to move firmly beyond the current mindset of the government in its agricultural and industrial policy Markets private business and entrepreneurs should set much of the pace but government and public agencies should also play roles that go far beyond the neoliberal trinity of property rights protection contract enforcement and sound money The government should set out clear coherent and achievable strategy for every sector which enables the country to have comparative advantage and competitive in the global economy The aim of the national education and skills development strategies should be primarily aimed to create wellskilled and adaptive workforces capable of responding quickly to changes both in the national and global economy and properly utilized by employers Governments need to ensure that the overall skills level of their working population is as high as possible to allow them to compete But this compact works two ways The skills already existing in the economy should be being properly utilized by businesses with those in lowerskilled sectors given access to with opportunities

"2020_12";"One Vaccine Side Effect Global Economic Inequalitytxt";" LONDON  The end of the pandemic is finally in view So is rescue from the most traumatic global economic catastrophe since the Great Depression As Covid vaccines enter the bloodstream recovery has become reality But the benefits will be far from equally apportioned Wealthy nations in Europe and North America have secured the bulk of limited stocks of vaccines positioning themselves for starkly improved economic fortunes Developing countries  home to most of humanity  are left to secure their own doses The lopsided distribution of vaccines appears certain to worsen a defining economic reality The world that emerges from this terrifying chapter in history will be more unequal than ever Poor countries will continue to be ravaged by the pandemic forcing them to expend meager resources that are already stretched by growing debts to lenders in the United States Europe and China The global economy has long been cleaved by profound disparities in wealth education and access to vital elements like clean water electricity and the internet The pandemic has trained its death and destruction of livelihood on ethnic minorities women and lowerincome households The ending is likely to add another division that could shape economic life for years separating countries with access to vaccines from those without Its clear that developing countries and especially poorer developing countries are going to be excluded for some time said Richard KozulWright director of the division on globalization and development strategies at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva Despite the understanding that vaccines need to be seen as a global good the provision remains largely under control of large pharmaceutical companies in the advanced economies International aid organizations philanthropists and wealthy nations have coalesced around a promise to ensure that all countries gain the tools needed to fight the pandemic like protective gear for medical teams as well as tests therapeutics and vaccines But they have failed to back their assurances with enough money The leading initiative the ActAccelerator Partnership  an undertaking of the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation among others  has secured less than 5 billion of a targeted 38 billion A group of developing countries led by India and South Africa sought to increase the supply of vaccines by manufacturing their own ideally in partnership with the pharmaceutical companies that have produced the leading versions In a bid to secure leverage the group has proposed that the World Trade Organization waive traditional protections on intellectual property allowing poor countries to make affordable versions of the vaccines The WTO operates on consensus The proposal has been blocked by the United States Britain and the European Union where pharmaceutical companies wield political influence The industry argues that patent protections and the profits they derive are a requirement for the innovation that yields lifesaving medicines Proponents of suspending patents note that many blockbuster drugs are brought to market via governmentfinanced research arguing that this creates an imperative to place social good at the heart of policy The question is really Is this a time to profit said Mustaqeem De Gama councilor at the South African mission to the WTO in Geneva We have seen governments closing down economies limiting freedoms yet intellectual property is seen to be so sacrosanct that this cannot be touched In the wealthy nations that have secured access to vaccines relief from the economic disaster brought on by the public health emergency is underway The restrictions that have shut down businesses could be lifted bringing meaningful economic benefits as soon as March or April For the moment the picture is bleak The United States the worlds largest economy has suffered death tolls equivalent to a 911 every day making a return to normalcy appear distant Major economies like Britain France and Germany are under fresh lockdowns as the virus maintains momentum But after contracting 42 percent this year the global economy appears set to expand by 52 percent next year according to Oxford Economics That forecast assumes annual growth of 42 percent in the United States and a 78 percent expansion in China the worlds secondlargest economy where government action has controlled the virus Europe will remain a laggard given the prevalence of the virus according to IHS Markit with the continents economy not returning to its precrisis size for two years But a deal struck between Britain and the European Union on Thursday preserving much of their trading relationship after Brexit has eased the worst fears about a slowdown in regional commerce But by 2025 the longterm economic damage from the pandemic will be twice as severe in socalled emerging markets compared with wealthy countries according to Oxford Economics Such forecasts are notoriously inexact A year ago no one was predicting a calamitous pandemic The variables now confronting the global economy are especially enormous The production of vaccines is fraught with challenges that could limit supply while their endurance and effectiveness are not fully understood The economic recovery will be shaped by questions of psychology After the most profound shock in memory how will societies exercise their freedom to move about once the virus is tamed Will people liberated from lockdowns pack together in movie theaters and on airplanes Any lingering disinclination toward human congregation is likely to limit growth in the leisure and hospitality industries which are major employers The pandemic has accelerated the advance of ecommerce leaving traditional brickandmortar retailers in an especially weakened state If an enduring sense of anxiety prompts shoppers to avoid malls that could limit job growth Online retailers like Amazon have aggressively embraced automation meaning that an increase in business does not necessarily translate into quality jobs Many economists assume that as the vaccines ease fear people will surge toward experiences that have been off limits thronging restaurants sporting events and holiday destinations Households have saved up as they have canceled vacations and entertained themselves at home If peoples spirits are eased and some of the restrictions are lifted you could see a spending splurge said Ben May a global economist at Oxford Economics in London A lot of this will be about the speed and degree to which people go back to more normal behaviors Thats very hard to know But many developing countries will find themselves effectively inhabiting a different planet The United States has secured claims on as many as 15 billion doses of vaccine while the European Union has locked up nearly two billion doses  enough to vaccinate all of their citizens and then some Many poor countries could be left waiting until 2024 to fully vaccinate their populations High debt burdens limit the ability of many poor countries to pay for vaccines Private creditors have declined to take part in a debt suspension initiative championed by the Group of 20 Promised aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund has proved disappointing At the IMF the Trump administration has opposed an expansion of socalled special drawing rights  the basic currency of the institution  depriving poor countries of additional resources The international response to the pandemic has essentially been pitiful said Mr KozulWright at the UN trade body We are worried that as we move into the distribution of the vaccines we are going to see the same again One element of the ActAccelerator partnership known as Covax is meant to allow poor countries to buy vaccines at affordable prices but it collides with the reality that production is both limited and controlled by profitminded companies that are answerable to shareholders Most people in the world live in countries where they rely on Covax for access to vaccines said Mark EcclestonTurner an expert on international law and infectious diseases at Keele University in England That is an extraordinary market failure Access to vaccines is not based on need Its based on the ability to pay and Covax doesnt fix that problem On Dec 18 Covax leaders announced a deal with pharmaceutical companies aimed at providing low and middleincome countries with nearly two billion doses of vaccines The arrangement which centers on vaccine candidates that have not yet gained approval would provide enough doses to vaccinate onefifth of the populations in 190 participating countries by the end of next year India is home to pharmaceutical manufacturers that are producing vaccines for multinational companies including AstraZeneca but its population is unlikely to be fully vaccinated before 2024 according to TS Lombard an investment research firm in London Its economy is likely to remain vulnerable Even if masses of people in poor countries do not gain access to vaccines their economies are likely to receive some spillover benefits from wealthier nations return to normal In a world shaped by inequality growth can coincide with inequity As consumer power resumes in North America Europe and East Asia that will drive demand for commodities rejuvenating copper mines in Chile and Zambia and lifting exports of soybeans harvested in Brazil and Argentina Tourists will eventually return to Thailand Indonesia and Turkey But some argue that the ravages of the pandemic in poor countries largely unchecked by vaccines could limit economic fortunes globally If the poorest countries do not gain vaccines the global economy will surrender 153 billion a year in output according to arecent study from the RAND Corporation You need to vaccinate health care workers globally so you can reopen global markets said Clare Wenham a health policy expert at the London School of Economics If every country in the world can say We know all our vulnerable people are vaccinated then we can return to the global capitalist trading system much quicker PHOTO Vials of vaccine at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia Wealthy nations have vowed
