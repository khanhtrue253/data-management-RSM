## Description

This folder contains projects in the course Analyzing Digital Footprint at RSM (Master). In this course, students learn about version control's best practice, critically examine digital footprints, and learn to use API to scrape web data.

This work is interested if you want to examine my skills in: Data management & ethics, ML and insights.

## Directions

  - Group project involves a group of students scraping data from Kiva (a P2P lending platform) using API and perform analysis to derive insights.
  - Individual project involves student request their own personal data from platforms, censor them, reflect in terms of personal & GDPR, and cite examples of what platforms can/cannot do with such data.
