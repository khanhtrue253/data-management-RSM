The repository contains the following files:
  - The Rmarkdown file that produces the written report (written_report.Rmd)
  - The produced written report (written_report.html)
  - The scripts used to produce masked data from platforms, which is included in the written report (process_data_NameOfPlatform.R). NameOfPlatform here corresponds to the platform (for example, if NameOfPlatform is Facebook, it means that the script takes in Facebook data and produces the masked version of it).
  - The folder Processed_Data, which contains the masked data that is the result from the scripts above (process_data_NameOfPlatform.Rdata). Similar to above, NameOfPlatform here corresponds to the platform.
  - The folder Supplement_Media, which contains screenshots of company's Privacy Policies and GDPR regulations to supplement the written report. Files in the folder are named as PartX_FigureY.png, corresponding to the part in report and order of appearance in the written report.
