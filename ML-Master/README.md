## Description

This group project involves a group of students developing a prediction algorithm for student enrollment. Based on the information available about the students from previous years, the algorithm takes information about students in 23-24 cohort on March 15 2023, and predict whether they actually enrolled at the university. The prediction is used for scheduling classes and allocating resources for programs.
