Jan 2021;"Russia Uses Strategic Reserve to Soak Up Surplus Jet Fuel";"Russia used its strategic stockpile to siphon off excess jet fuel last year as the pandemic ravaged the aviationsector. Rosreserv, a state-owned agency that stockpiles strategic goods ranging from petroleum products to sugarand beans, came to the rescue for Russia’s jet fuel market. The secretive entity purchased nearly 432,000 metrictons of jet during 2020, a more than fourfold increase on 2019, according to data on railroad deliveries seen byEnergy Intelligence. The 350,000 tons of additional jet snapped up by Rosreserv last year still pales in comparisonto the approximate 2.6 million tons (56,990 barrels per day) annual decline in supplies sent to Russian airports forcivilian aircraft.Rail data show that deliveries to airports fell 1.76 million tons year on year to 3.19 million tons. Pipeline deliveries toa handful of airports declined some 850,000 tons over the year to 1.7 million tons, a source told Energy Intelligence.Those supplies were sent to the three hubs in Moscow, Pulkovo in St. Petersburg, and the airport in Ufa to the westof the Ural mountains. To dispose of excess jet fuel refiners blended about 2.15 million tons into the diesel pool lastyear, a 53% increase compared to 2019, according to balances compiled from railroad data.Russia's refining industry is the world's third-largest, behind the US and China. Unlike in most countries whererefiners slashed utilization rates to contain a mounting product surplus, the Russian downstream sector producedsome 10.5 million tons (230,000 b/d) of jet fuel in 2020. That was down just 2 million tons or 16% from 2019volumes, based on Energy Intelligence calculations.Balances show that 7.68 million tons were delivered to various consumers and outlets by rail last year, including forairports, exports, blendstock, strategic storage and military usage. Novatek’s condensate splitter produced 1.06million tons of jet for the year, down a mere 20,000 barrels year on year. Russian rail exports of jet fuel plummeted34% to 462,540 tons. But total exports including Novatek volumes amounted to 1.52 million tons. All of thosesupplies were shipped abroad from a port on the Gulf of Finland. Russian jet fuel exports to Europe in the first ninemonths of 2020 plunged by 55% to 648,000 tons, according to International Energy Agency data ( JFI Dec.25'20 ).A summer revival in Russia's domestic travel brought air traffic inside the country close to 2019 levels -- the onlydomestic market to show a nearly complete rebound last year. Grounding of international flights led to a 46%decline in passenger numbers last year to 69.1 million, the country’s industry regulator Rosaviatsia announced thisweek. That setback follows several years of double-digit growth and a new record set in 2019. As the country’slargest carrier, Aeroflot-International Airlines accounted for 30% of all passengers handled by Russian airlines in2019. Its reliance on international routes caused a 61% drop in passengers ( JFI Nov.20'20 ). By contrast, theAeroflot Group’s discount carrier Pobeda focuses on domestic routes and saw a 12% fall over the year to 9.1 millionpassengers. Preliminary reports indicate the airline even posted a 1.4 billion ruble ($18 million) profit for the year.Pobeda’s success as Russia’s fastest growing carrier has sparked a discussion about the need to create at leastone other discount carrier. Transport Minister Vitaly Saveliev, the former CEO of the Aeroflot Group, told Russianmedia that the country’s largest bank was considering investing in a new low-cost carrier that would ultimatelycompete with Pobeda. Rosaviatsia held a meeting on Jan. 20 with industry officials and potential investors,including existing airlines. Saveliev earlier said it made sense to base the new airline in Siberia and that a total ofthree discount carriers could eventually cover the entire Russian domestic market. A new niche airline would helpthe recovery in Russia’s aviation industry, given potential growth in civilian air traffic and underutilized airportcapacity. The government also hopes to sell hundreds of Russian-made MS-21 narrow-body aircraft. Theembryonic plan involves the creation of the new low-cost carrier within an existing company. But reports indicatethat Russia’s largest airlines are not enthusiastic about the idea and don’t want to change their business models asthey emerge from the pandemic.Gary Peach, New York"
Jan 2021;"Global economy heals";"IMF raises world growth forecast THE International Monetary Fund has lifted its global economic growth forecastfor the year ahead amid the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and noted Australia's recovery has been stronger thanexpected.The latest update from one of the world's most highly regarded financial institutions estimates the global economywill grow by 5.5 per cent in 2021 and 4.2 per cent in 2022.The 2021 forecast is 0.3 of a percentage point higher than what the IMF predicted in October but less than the 5.8per cent it forecast in April last year.The update, released overnight, does not include a specific forecast for Australia but notes that the nation's mostrecent economic growth numbers ""mostly surprised on the upside"".Commodity prices such as oil and metals are also expected to ""accelerate strongly"" this year in what looms as awindfall for the nation's coffers.IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and increased stimulus spending in majoreconomies such as the United States and Japan paved the way for a stronger global recovery in 2021. But shecautioned the international economy continued to face ""tremendous uncertainty"" amid renewed waves and newvariants of the virus.""Much now depends on the outcome of this race between a mutating virus and vaccines to end the pandemic,""said. ""If downside risks were to materialise, a tightening of financial conditions could amplify the downturn at a timewhen public and corporate debt are at record highs worldwide."
Jan 2021;"December diesel demand crawls up to 97% of pre-pandemic level";"NEW DELHI: India's diesel consumption continued to cover slack in December but still remained 3% less than thesame month of 2019, indicating the economy is gradually coming out of the woods.Diesel consumption, one of thekey barometers of economic activity, had fallen 7% from the year-ago period in November after shooting past thepre-pandemic level for the first time in eight months in October by clocking a 6% year-on-year growth.In contrast,petrol demand during the month more or less maintained the pace of annual growth at 8.7%, a tad below 9% seenin November on the back of holiday driving and positive sentiment in the car market.December sales data of publicsector retailers, who command about 90% of the market, show jet fuel also covering ground to remain 43% lessthan December 2019 as overseas flights faced fresh curtailments. On a month-on-month basis, however, sales injumped 11% from November level on the back of rising domestic travel by air for holidays.November jet fuel sales were down more than 48% from the same month of 2019.LPG, or common householdcooking gas, showed a 7.6% growth in annual demand during December, or more than double of November sales,as the temperature plummeted across north and east India.The gradual recovery in demand for all fuels boostedrefiners, with state-run IndianOil, the country's largest refiner and fuel retailer, last month cranking up operations atall its refineries to 100%.

Jan 2021;"US Crude Hits 11-month High on Biden Stimulus Package";"Oil prices jumped late in the week in anticipation of US President-elect Joe Biden's announcement of a $1.9 trillionrecovery package for the pandemic-ravaged US economy. The news threw sunshine on an otherwise cloudymarket still anxious about galloping coronavirus infection rates and concerns about the speed of a rebound in oildemand. Biden spoke after markets closed. He confirmed an extra $1,400 stimulus check for every US adult on topof the $600 agreed last month, plus a whole host of other spending.US crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate closed at an 11-month high of $53.57 per barrel Thursday, up$2.74/bbl on the week. International price-pin Brent gained $2.04/bbl to finish at $56.42/bbl having struck its ownpost-Covid-19 high earlier in the week. Brent flirted with $57/bbl Tuesday -- a rally analysts partly put down tosurplus liquidity sloshing around financial markets and looking for a home. Saudi Arabia’s surprise 1 million barrelper day output cut has also helped light a fire under prices, as have Covid-19 vaccine rollouts.European jet fuel premiums slumped after the region’s air traffic took yet another hit, even as underlying ICE gasoilfutures tracked crude higher. Several European countries are scrambling to ban arrivals from South America, and insome cases Portugal, in a bid to stop the spread of a dangerous new Covid-19 variant found in Brazil amid fears itcould prove resistant to vaccines. Eurocontrol Director-General Eamonn Brennan warned Thursday that thenetwork manager would be revising down its air traffic forecasts for February onward in the coming days after flightnumbers fell 65% below 2019 levels this week. The contango in European jet fuel has already flattened as hopesfor a sharp summer recovery fade (see table). A smaller European aviation industry is set to emerge from thepandemic. Norwegian Airlines said this week it had abandoned its low-cost, long-haul model and would onlyoperate regional and domestic Norwegian routes after Covid-19.Six jet fuel cargoes traded in Europe’s public pricing window last week, all of them indexed to Platts assessmentsto reflect the current market uncertainty. European supermajor Royal Dutch Shell has switched to the buy side thisyear having completely dominated selling throughout 2020. Shell bought 120,000 metric tons between Jan. 8-14,including from rival major BP on board the LR1 <em>Flagship Sage</em> sitting in UK Southwold anchorage andFrench oil company Total on the LR2 <em>Nordmarlin</em> coming from Ruwais in the United Arab Emirates.Shell also bought jet on unnamed ships from China’s Unipec, as did Swiss trader Vitol. The recent sharp drop inimports is starting to drain tanks. Closely watched jet stocks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp were down for asecond week to 934,000 tons on Jan. 14, according to Insights Global. Jet tanks are still more than 50% higherthan year-earlier levels while gasoil stocks are now in deficit.An improved outlook for the US economy helped spur a late-day futures rally on Thursday. Basis ultra-low-sulfurdiesel futures jumped by 2¢ per gallon to close at $1.62, lifting the February contract by 7¢ on the week. US jet fuelmarket fundamentals tightened up as a spurt in sales far exceeded output from refiners. The tail end of holidaytravel spurred a 60% surge in demand from the prior week to 1.468 million b/d in the week ended Jan. 8, accordingto Energy Information Administration figures. But a steep drop in passengers since then is likely to push jet salesback this week. Over the last four weeks average sales of 1.2 million b/d are one-third lower than in early 2020,signaling continued recovery from the pandemic. Airlines are seeing continued weakness in forward bookings in thefirst quarter. Delta Air Lines is cutting first-quarter capacity by 35% from year-ago levels. But most carriers arelooking forward to gradual improvement through the balance of the year, with a significant uptick in late 2021 asvaccines are more widely administered.The imbalance between supply and demand reduced US jet stocks by 1.5 million barrels to 37.3 million bbl -- nearly8% below the year-ago mark. Refiners boosted utilization rates to 82% of capacity to meet strengthening demandfor diesel and gasoline. Jet output climbed to 1.24 million b/d but lagged pre-Covid-19 levels by 700,000 b/d.Average prices of $1.52/gallon were the highest since late February last year, but still 40¢ below the year-ago mark.Jet spreads weakened slightly on the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor, offsetting some of the gain in basis dieselfutures. Gulf Coast differentials fell to 16¢ below February diesel futures, while New York Harbor spreads weakenedto 12¢ below the print.Asian jet markets softened as the refiners were faced with worsening incentives to produce jet rather than gasoil.The benchmark Singapore spot price differential weakened by 9¢/bbl from a week ago to a discount of 25¢/bbl toSingapore quotes on Jan. 14. The prompt regrade, which reflects how much stronger jet is compared to gasoil,tumbled by 25¢/bbl to negative 92¢/bbl on Thursday. Refiners are earning much more from producing and sellinggasoil rather than jet, which could further reduce jet yields across the region. A total of 100,000 bbl of late January-loading jet traded from Jan. 8-14 in the Platts Singapore trading window, which helps set jet prices for Asia.Mabanaft sold the volumes to Unipec.Jet arbitrage flows from East of Suez to west of the canal rose by 33,000 tons to 269,000 tons in the week startingJan. 11, according to data intelligence company Kpler. Five tankers are expected to load these volumes from India,the Mideast and South Korea. The newly built very large crude carrier (VLCC) <em>Halcyon</em> chartered byTrafigura is carrying 63,000 tons of jet and indicating Lome, Togo, as its destination, with an expected arrival dateof Jan. 16, according to Kpler. The newly built VLCC <em>Seavoice</em> is carrying 64,000 tons of jet and hadbeen floating off Fujairah. It is now indicating Rotterdam as its destination, with an expected arrival date of Feb. 13,Kpler added. European Quarterly Jet Fuel Swaps Quotes Quarter Chg.

Jan 2021;"Aviation's Covid-19 Recovery Still Five Years Away";"It could take another five years for Europe's aviation industry to recover from its Covid-19 downturn, while regionaldemand for conventional jet fuel may never return to pre-pandemic levels if efforts to ""build back better"" result inincreased uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) before then.A new Think Paper from Europe's air traffic controller Eurocontrol reckons it will be 2026 before European flightnumbers return to 2019 levels. This assumes that effective Covid-19 vaccines are not widely enough available untilnext year.Eurocontrol modeling shows flight numbers rising almost 17% this year compared to last. But the expected 5.64million flights is only 51% of the 11 million-plus departures -- the measurement used to capture European flights toall destinations -- seen in 2019. A much bigger jump to over 8 million is forecast for 2022 as more travelers arevaccinated.Even under a more rapid vaccine rollout, with all travelers inoculated this year, Eurocontrol still would not expect tosee regional air traffic return to 2019 levels until 2024. In a more pessimistic scenario, ineffective vaccines wouldpush the recovery back to 2029 at the earliest.The agency says aviation's slow recovery, even under the most optimistic scenarios, should be used as a windowof opportunity to build back better, including adoption of the EU's fuel-saving Single European Sky (SES) schemeand the funding of decarbonization efforts.It's thought that the SES alone could shave up to 10% from European jet fuel demand by making flying moreefficient.Meanwhile, Eurocontrol has called for any future taxation of aviation to be used to boost the uptake of SAF ( IODDec.22'20 ).European airline carbon emissions were 56.7% lower in January-November 2020 versus the same period of 2019,according to the latest available data. During that same period regional air traffic fell 54% to levels last seen in themid-1980s.Emissions savings were greater since fewer flights meant less congestion, allowing planes to fly more direct andfuel-efficient routes. Eurocontrol says the relaxation of more than 1,200 regional airspace restrictions since the startof the Covid-19 crisis has saved airlines up to 26,000 nautical miles a day.SAF is still the only carbon-saving option for long-haul flights over 1,500 kilometers which accounted for 74.6% ofaircraft emissions in 2019, despite making up only 29.8% of departures.Short-haul routes are more suitable for electrification, given current battery weight and performance. While flightsunder 500 km account for 24.1% of European departures, they only contribute 3.8% of emissions.Eurocontrol data show European air traffic collapsing 55% year on year in 2020 to just 4.8 million flights as nationalgovernments imposed strict travel restrictions in a bid to control the deadly virus.Traffic had been building up ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, before the discovery of new far moreinfectious strains of Covid-19 in the UK and South Africa triggered fresh lockdowns.Traffic fell back down to 63.3% below 2019 levels in the seven days to Jan. 6 compared to only a 47.9% deficit inthe week to Dec. 23.Spot jet fuel markets are starting to feel the pressure, although traders say widespread domestic refinery run cutsand a sharp drop in East of Suez imports this month have kept a floor under premiums that were still $20 per metricton above ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures at Thursday's close.Kerry Preston, London"
Jan 2021;"Oil Prices Wobble on Rising Covid-19 Cases and Vaccine Shortages";"Oil prices wobbled as surging Covid-19 case numbers and vaccine supply problems left large swaths of the globaleconomy stuck in lockdown and fuel demand in fresh tatters. International benchmark Brent held its head above$55 per barrel, as it mostly has since early January, closing up 88¢/bbl on the week at $55.53/bbl Thursday. Themarket is backwardated -- with prices falling over time -- reflecting the extent to which any demand recovery hasbeen pushed back by a fresh peak of Covid-19 caseloads. The world’s top oil buyer China imposed freshrestrictions ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays as infection rates surged. Oil demand growth is expected to kickin again from the summer once vaccination programs start to work. But there are major problems in the EU, whereBrussels is scrambling for vaccine supplies. In the US, President Joe Biden is struggling to make up for the Trumpadministration’s lack of planning.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate closed at $52.34/bbl Thursday, down 79¢/bbl on the week despite a 10million barrel drop in crude stocks that would have normally lifted prices. There was a very nice draw on US crudestocks yet there was no reaction,"" Star Fuels senior broker Matt Stanley wrote in a note. Oil prices could drawsome support from emerging policies from the administration of Biden, who is pursuing a hawkish climate agendatargeting both pipeline infrastructure and upstream activity on federal lands. Both could end up pinching supplydown the road, even as economic stimulus measures help bolster demand.European jet cargo premiums crumbled as tough new border restrictions were introduced to tackle the latest waveof Covid and risks associated with new variants of the deadly virus. Germany is planning a near-total ban ontravelers from the UK, Portugal, Brazil and South Africa following similar actions already taken by Belgium and theNetherlands. The EU otherwise requires a negative Covid-19 test and 10-day quarantine for travelers from all but ashort list of countries, not including the UK. The UK will soon force people coming from 22 high-risk countries toquarantine in designated hotels at their own expense. With all but essential travel made impractical, European airtraffic was down 66% below 2019 levels in the week to Jan. 28, according to the latest figures from Eurocontrol.The network manager has produced a set of dismal traffic forecasts for the first half of this year with flight numbersset to fall three-quarters below pre-pandemic levels in February and March with a 70% deficit still forecast for Juneif vaccine rollouts fail to boost nonessential air travel ( related ).Jet cargoes were pegged at a $17 per metric ton premium to front-month ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures in NorthwestEurope at Thursday’s close, down from $22/ton last week. Another five deals in the Platts market-on-close windowtook January volume to a record 510,000 tons for the month with China’s Unipec the dominant seller and Europeanmajor Royal Dutch Shell by far the biggest buyer. Unipec sold 120,000 tons to Shell this week, split between LeHavre and Rotterdam delivery, plus a further 30,000 tons to Swiss trader Vitol in Rotterdam, all against floatingPlatts c.i.f cargo mean (CCM) pricing. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) fell for a fourth week in arow to 903,000 tons, according to Insights Global, after no import tankers discharged but small volume left for theUK and Irish kerosene markets. ARA tanks are their lowest in eight weeks but a record 82% above year-earlierlevels. Tanker tracker Kpler pegs January jet arrivals at 1.4 million tons, the highest since the summer but downfrom over 2 million tons in January last year. Barely 500,000 tons is tracked for February arrival so far but that figureis certain to rise.US jet fuel markets have struck a precarious balance around the 1.2 million barrel per day mark -- where supplyand demand landed in the week ended Jan. 22. Imports surged to 247,000 b/d and landed mainly on the WestCoast. That region became more dependent on imported supplies with the closure of two California refineries lastyear. Both plants will be repurposed to produce renewable diesel, which has become an important revenue streamfor US refiners. California jet demand has plummeted since lockdowns were imposed. Air traffic at Los Angelesairport dropped by 70%-80% for domestic and international flights in December.Jet prices held steady in line with ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures, which closed at $1.60 per gallon on Thursday. Jetspreads weakened through the month of January, falling to 18¢/gallon below diesel futures on the Gulf Coast, a12.5¢ discount in New York Harbor and 10¢ below the futures contract in Los Angeles. Outright jet quotes rangedfrom $1.41-$1.57/gallon and were in line with 30-day averages as weaker spreads offset gains in diesel futures.Refiners are maintaining a disciplined approach to jet fuel output even as they ramp up supplies of road transportfuels. They will continue to blend jet fuel into the diesel pool so long as demand remains weak. At 1.24 million b/d,sales are still 430,000 b/d short of the year-ago mark.Asian jet markets weakened as air traffic and jet demand in China plunged due to new lockdowns and thegovernment’s move to discourage residents from returning to their hometowns for the upcoming Chinese New Yearfestival. Scheduled airline capacity to, from and within China for the week of Jan. 25 plunged by 1.4 million seatmiles, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. The benchmark Singapore spot price differential dropped by9¢/bbl from a week ago to a discount of 27¢/bbl to Singapore quotes on Jan. 27.The arbitrage flow of jet from East of Suez to west of the canal rose by 32,000 tons to 290,000 tons in the weekstarting Jan. 25, according to data intelligence company Kpler. The bulk of those volumes came from the Mideast,with 160,000 tons from the United Arab Emirates and 44,000 tons from Qatar. The remaining 86,000 tons werefrom South Korea. The newly built very large crude carrier <em>Seavoice</em> chartered by Total is carryingaround 271,000 tons of gasoil and jet. The tanker had originally been expected to deliver her cargo to SoutheastAsia, but is now signaling a destination of the Cape of Good Hope for further orders, Kpler noted.

Jan 2021;"Europe: New Lockdowns Hurt Oil Demand in Europe";"Vaccine rollouts have brought hope of a return to normality for Europe, but it remains just that -- hope. Thecontinent’s product markets are still stuck in a vicious cycle of demand destruction after a new more virulent waveof Covid-19 sparked a third round of lockdown restrictions at the start of 2021. For the first quarter, EnergyIntelligence downgraded the consumption forecast for European and US demand by a combined 500,000 barrelsper day ( related ). Asia might be next ( related ).In Europe, the jet fuel market remains hardest hit with regional air traffic down 66.7% below same-day 2019 levelsmid-January and the region’s air traffic controller Eurocontrol warning it will take another five years for flightnumbers to recover. Current restrictions on road travel in Europe are almost as severe as during the first wave ofthe pandemic last April, when demand for jet, gasoline and diesel collapsed by 2.9 million b/d in the second quartercompared to the second quarter of 2019, Energy Intelligence data show ( OMI Jul.15'20 ).Support is coming from the supply side with product prices mostly firming relative to crude due to refinery run cuts.European refinery crude intake was just 10.3 million b/d in December, for a utilization rate of just 71%, down 12%-points from December 2019 ( related ). Gasoline markets have also benefited from strong export sales to the US --traffic hit 550,000 tons in December, according to tanker trackers, up almost a fifth on the previous year -- while asharp drop in imports has supported middle distillates.Sharply lower Asian jet and ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) imports have helped clear some of Europe’s floatingstorage overhang and put a floor under regional prices. Barely 1 million tons of ULSD is coming from the Mideastand Asia this month, down from almost 2.5 million tons in December, while parallel flows of jet are set to drop tojust 400,000 tons, down from up to 2 million tons per month before the pandemic. Hopes of a sharp recovery inairline fuel demand this summer are fading as new more infectious Covid-19 variants discovered in the UK, SouthAfrica and Brazil trigger fresh travel bans.Europe’s ULSD market faces a surge in short-haul Russian arrivals with Primorsk loadings at a nine-month high of1.557 million metric tons (375,000 b/d) this month. Sailings are back to levels last seen in April, before the fullextent of Covid-19 demand destruction became apparent. Trans-Atlantic ULSD flows are also ramping up withheavy traffic expected in the second half of January. Weaker US markets have also stemmed the unusual reverseflow of diesel from Europe seen late last year ( OMI Dec.17'20 ).Road demand faces a looming existential crisis in Europe even after Covid-19 as electric vehicle (EV) sales boomdespite the pandemic. EV sales nearly doubled to 673,000 last year, according to Oxford’s LMC Automotive, at thesame time that sales of diesel-only models tanked 35% to less than 3 million and gasoline fell 21% to 7.7 million.Internal combustion engines will no longer be sold in Europe by 2030, although it will take much longer for the carfleet to go electric. The boom in EV sales is a combination of government support and surplus household cash aftermost Europeans were deprived of their summer holidays last year. PRICE Monthly Recent S Prices Week"
Jan 2021;"Asia: Chinese Lockdowns Hold Key to Short-Term Market";"Chinese gasoline and jet fuel demand normally rise significantly around the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday,which falls on Feb. 12 this year. But a recent resurgence of coronavirus cases in the provinces of Hebei, whichsurrounds Beijing, and in the northern province of Heilongjiang, have already forced more than 28 million peopleinto lockdowns and prompted calls to limit travel during the holiday. How the situation evolves over the next threeweeks will be key to China’s products demand around Chinese New Year -- and beyond.China kicked off a major lockdown in the central province of Hubei just two days before the Chinese New Yearholiday last year as cases in Hubei’s capital city Wuhan surged. The lockdown was later rapidly expanded to largeswaths of China, which crushed transportation fuels demand from end-January to around mid-March. China’sFebruary 2020 demand fell by 4.3 million b/d on the year with another 1.5 million b/d drop in March beforerecovering and ending the year down just 250,000 b/d ( OMI May20'20 ).For now, China’s products demand is expected to grow at a healthy pace in 2021 -- if the recent coronavirus casesare rapidly brought under control -- after China’s economic recovery continued on a strong footing in the fourthquarter of 2020, with GDP growing 6.5% from the same quarter a year ago. China’s apparent oil demand clocked inat a healthy 3.7% in November and 2.9% in December, which might be revised up ( related ).Rising refining runs reflect stronger demand but also rising refining overcapacity ( related ). This is in turn hasprompted the Beijing government to increase by 5% the volume of refined products refiners can export in a firstbatch of quotas for 2021. Higher exports quotas, at 29.5 million tons, come with private giant refiner ZhejiangPetrochemicals (ZPC) joining the fray with a 2 million ton export quota, which will add further pressure on the Asia-Pacific markets ( OMI Dec.17'20 ).The regional gasoline market is showing some strength on the back of higher oil prices and optimism thatvaccination could lead to a faster recovery in the region. The star performers among the light ends are naphtha andLPGs, which are benefiting from the strong petrochemicals demand in Asia, with several crackers resumingoperations this quarter. Energy Intelligence assesses the naphtha crack spread -- or differential to Oman crude -- atits highest premium since at least June 2017.Increased bunker and power generation demand has kept Asian fuel oil markets buoyed. Asian bunkerconsumption has been fairly resilient, rising approximately 70,000 b/d on the year to average 2.6 million b/d in 2020,consultancy FGE said. Such demand should be further supported this year, as economies gradually recover fromCovid-19 and trading activities resume.A year-end surge in electricity consumption across much of Asia -- due to a much colder than expected northernhemisphere winter -- has also lifted fuel oil for power generation. Japanese and South Korean utilities have beenlooking to boost oil-fired generation capacity via burning more fuel oil and LPG, amid scarce and costly supply ofalternative fuel sources like coal, LNG, nuclear and solar. Rising demand for low-sulfur fuel oil has triggered a flurryof crude buying, especially from West African producers ( related )."
Jan 2021;"Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel Rise to Meet Carbon Reduction";"The National Biodiesel Board issued the following news release:The biodiesel and renewable diesel industry kicks off the first ever Virtual National Biodiesel Conference and Expothis week. The temporary move from in-person meetings to a virtual gathering has not dampened spirits, however,as the outlook for America's sustainable petroleum diesel replacement remains strong among environmentalregulators, biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, and marketers.In his annual State of the Industry address, themed ""Rise 2021,"" National Biodiesel Board CEO Donnell Rehagenpointed to several factors contributing to increased demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel.""Last year we unveiled Vision 2020, our plan to grow to over six billion gallons by the year 2030, and, withadvancements in feedstocks, 15 billion gallons by 2050,"" he said. ""The biodiesel and renewable diesel industrybelieves, with strong data I might add, we will have the production and market demand to reach this previouslyunimaginable goal by 2030.""Specifically, Rehagen said states across the country have embraced sustainable fuels as part of their own efforts tomitigate greenhouse gas emissions within their borders. Those efforts took on greater significance during thepandemic as Americans witnessed natural reduction of smog and pollution from drivers staying home and usingless petroleum.Beyond the growth in demand for traditional biodiesel and renewable diesel in on-road and off-road transportationapplications, the increasing use of Bioheat(R) as an oilheat replacement, as well as interest in renewable jet fuels,are expanding new markets for the industry.Rehagen also reminded virtual attendees that at last year's conference in Tampa, the industry was celebrating therecently reinstated biodiesel tax incentive, which continues to encourage growth.""By renewing the biodiesel tax incentive through 2022, Congress sent a strong signal that it supports growth in thebiodiesel market and provided a much-needed economic lifeline to biodiesel producers and farmers across thiscountry,"" he said.""At the beginning of 2020, markets began to reflect our ambitious industry goals.

Feb 2021;"Global economic outlook and policy priorities";"Link to ImageLink to StoryAntoinette M. SayehDeputy Managing Director By Antoinette M. Sayeh(Keynote speech at the Warwick Economic Summit)As we gather virtually, almost a year on from the start of the pandemic, I would like to share with you how we seethe global economy and our outlook for it. I will also take the opportunity to talk about where we should be headed—that is, our policy priorities for the period ahead. And in keeping with the young, optimistic energy that surroundsme virtually with you all [today]—I will end with what the IMF believes is a once-in-a- generation opportunity that liesahead of us.But let me begin first with COVID-19—the biggest, most immediate crisis of our lifetimes. While the globaleconomy has started to climb back from the depths of the crisis, the recent resurgence in infections and spread ofnew variants is delaying our recovery. It is also a powerful reminder that we cannot achieve a sustainablerecovery anywhere unless we defeat the pandemic everywhere.These exceptional times call for exceptional action. Over the last year, countries around the world have cometogether to undertake synchronized actions to cushion the blow. This includes $14 trillion in fiscal support tohouseholds and firms; and $9 trillion in monetary support through interest rate cuts and other measures by centralbanks. These actions have helped to put a floor under the global economy, without which the economic impact ofthe pandemic could have been so much greater.The IMF, too, has moved with unprecedented speed and magnitude. The Fund was set up more than 75 yearsago precisely to help countries in such situations by fostering financial stability and monetary cooperation.Since the start of the pandemic, we have approved over $105 billion in total financing for 85 countries. Weexpanded concessional financing for low-income countries and provided immediate debt relief to 29 of the poorest,most vulnerable ones. We worked with the G20 on bilateral debt service relief and on a common framework toaddress unsustainable sovereign debt. And we provided real-time policy advice and capacity development supportto over 175 countries. Never in the history of the IMF have we done so much, so fast.So, what is the economic outlook? In our latest forecast released last week, we project global growth at 5.5percent in 2021, which reflects the positive effects of vaccinations in some countries, adaptation to containmentmeasures, and continued policy support. But just to be clear, we are still only in February. And there is tremendousuncertainty around this forecast, especially considering that we ended 2020 with a contraction of 3.5 percent,meaning the worst peacetime recession since the Great Depression.How we fare over the next few months will be critical—much of it will depend on the outcome of the race betweenthe mutating virus and vaccines, and on the ability of countries to provide continued support until herd immunity isachieved and the recovery is fully underway.Which is why our immediate priority , must be to bring the health crisis under control . The international communitymust act swiftly to ensure access to vaccines and medical treatments also for low- and middle-income economies.This will require ramping up production, bolstering funding for the COVAX facility and the logistics of vaccinedelivery. The health and economic arguments for this are overwhelming. We estimate that faster vaccinationswould raise global income cumulatively by $9 trillion over 2020­‑2025, with benefits for all countries.As we look toward recovery, we must consider the potential of lasting scars imposed by the pandemic—such scarscould emanate from interrupted schooling, dislocated workers, idled skills, investments on hold, and newtechnology on standby. Given the gravity of this crisis, our second priority must be to maintain economic lifelinesand policy support in countries where the virus is surging . This will help protect households and preventbankruptcies of otherwise viable firms, enabling a faster rebound once constraints are lifted.In countries where fiscal space is limited, spending should be prioritized for health and transfers to the poor. Andonly when infections are durably declining and economic activity is normalizing, should countries beginto gradually roll back these lifelines, while still cushioning the impact on the most vulnerable.Advanced economies with more fiscal space are, of course, expected to recover faster; but, around half of allemerging markets and developing economies who were previously converging with advanced economies in percapita income are now expected to diverge. Which is why, our third priority must be to reverse this dangerousdivergence between rich and poor countries . To do that, we must come together to help poor countries byproviding grants, highly concessional loans, and debt relief—including in some cases, to address unsustainablesovereign debt that may come up in the period ahead.As we take these steps to navigate our way out of this unprecedented crisis, we also have a once-in-a-lifetimeopportunity . An opportunity to put in place policies that not only strengthen our recovery in the short‑term butensure that we build a solid foundation for a more sustainable, inclusive economy in the years ahead. Simplyreturning to the low-growth and high-inequality economy of the past is no longer an option.Which is why, the IMF is calling for a synchronized investment in green and digital infrastructure , as the pandemicstarts to come under control.Governments must put in place public investments as well as incentives for private investments that supportlow‑carbon and climate-resilient growth. These could be, efficient mass transit systems, smart electricity grids orphasing out harmful subsidies. The IMF estimates that a combination of green investments and appropriate carbonpricing can put us on a path towards net-zero emissions by mid-century and help create millions of new jobs.Similarly, we know that the economy of the future will be digital—each of you, know this especially well. So,countries must enable a planned transition by investing in digital infrastructure—be it e-commerce, e‑learning,e‑government or digital money and payments.Of course, green and digital investment must also include support for workers as they transition from shrinking toexpanding sectors. Increased investment in training, re-skilling and high-quality education will be pivotal tounlocking the potential of a green and digital economy. Already widely understood, this is nonetheless an importantpoint needing greater attention than it has received in the past.At the IMF, we are moving fast in both of these areas. We are incorporating climate change into our country andfinancial risk assessments and are scaling up capacity development in this area. We are also working with countrieson policies that enable the new digital paradigm to become an engine of growth and financial inclusion.So, let me now conclude by saying this: 2021 will be the most consequential year of our lifetimes. If the internationalcommunity can come together to help each other get to the other side of the pandemic, we can exit the crisis withminimal economic scarring. And if we begin to sow the right seeds of investments and policies today, we cango even further and build the foundation of a 21st century economy—one that each of you will inherit.MENAFN07022021000232011072ID1101562562"

Feb 2021;"Jet fuel price hinges on a rebound in air cargo, commercial flights";"Refrigerated containers carrying AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford Covid-19 vaccines exit from a cargoaircraft at Galeao Air Base in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Global jet fuel markets pin their hopes on a rebound in aircargo demand and spur in international flights on mass vaccine roll-outs in several key countries this year.Pratap JohnGlobal jet fuel markets pin their hopes on a rebound in air cargo demand and spur in international flights on massvaccine roll-outs in several key countries this year.Air cargo demand is expected to receive a further boost globally as airlines have begun playing a key role in massvaccine roll-outs.But whether passenger traffic will have a similar recovery this year remains to be seen as several countriesrenewed travel restrictions to battle a resurgence in coronavirus cases.The pandemic brought air travel to a virtual halt last year, and analysts say it may take years before global appetitefor jet fuel returns to pre-pandemic levels.While passenger air travel globally has recovered from its plunge to near total stoppage in May last year, thenumber of scheduled flights remained around 45% below year-ago levels in November 2020.Cargo traffic, however, has recovered far more briskly, and in October last year was only 6% below year-ago levels,thanks to booming e-commerce.Fuel efficiency, in terms of capacity use, ie per Available Tonne Kilometres (ATK) would have improved by 2% in2020 and expected at the same rate in 2021, as older aircraft will be retired or put into storage.As much of the industry was grounded throughout the second quarter of the year and capacity has not fullyrecovered, CO2 emissions were expected to be 47% lower in 2020 compared to 2019, an IATA analysis showed.In 2021, with the increased use of fuel efficient aircraft and slowly recovering air transport services, CO2 emissionswill rise but are still forecast to be 33% lower than pre-crisis levels.Fuel is such a large cost for airlines that it is the focus of intense efforts across the industry to find efficiencyimprovements.Such gains can take a variety of forms including replacing fleet with new aircraft, more efficient operations andefforts to persuade governments to remove the airspace and airport inefficiencies that waste around 5% of fuelburned each year.Industry experts say fuel costs constitute roughly one-third of an airline's operating costs. Hence, a marginalchange in crude oil prices can significantly impact its profitability.Jet fuel prices have long driven airline profitability and the aviation industry as a whole, representing between 14%and as much as 31% of airline operating costs in the past decade, an estimate shows.Consequently, airlines hedge a large portion of their annual fuel consumption at lower oil prices in order to protectthemselves from the volatility in oil prices.The global body of airlines – IATA estimates that jet fuel will average $59.8/barrel this year. This, it said will have a$35.8bn impact on the airline industry's 2021 fuel bill.Meanwhile, Asian refining margins for jet fuel rose on February 2 to their strongest in nearly two weeks, helped bytighter supplies of the aviation fuel and hopes that Covid-19 vaccines would help boost cross-border travel incoming months.The airline industry has been the weakest link in the recovery of fuel consumption that was decimated when thepandemic first hit last year, robbing refiners of one of their biggest customers, according to Bloomberg.Things may get worse for aviation fuel as the Biden administration in the US vows tough enforcement of safetytravel measures, including self-quarantine for people arriving from other countries.The aviation sector consumed almost 8% of oil products globally in 2019, or almost 7.5mn barrels per dayaccording to BloombergNEF's 2020 Aviation Fuel Outlook. The impact of Covid-19 on jet fuel consumption will befelt until 2026, when demand will return to 2019 levels. Despite passenger air recovering to 2019 levels by 2024,and freight by 2023, the early retirement of older aircraft, like the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, will lead to a moreefficient fleet in operation.In 2020, Covid-19 grounded much of the world's aircraft, leading to almost a halving of fuel consumption. Long-term, however, the appetite for air travel is expected to grow.And with few alternatives and without significant policy intervention, air miles will continue to be powered by fossilfuels.Many analysts, however, don't see jet fuel demand materially recovering until the second half of 2021 at theearliest with mass vaccine availability.*Pratap John is Business Editor at Gulf Times.

Feb 2021;"Oil Rally Stalls as Vaccine Delays Stoke Demand Fears";"An eight-day oil price rally came to an abrupt halt Thursday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) cut its first-quarter demand forecast for the umpteenth time. Longer-than-anticipated Covid-19 lockdowns and slow vaccinationprograms in places like Europe prompted the IEA to shave another 100,000 barrels per day off oil demand from itsfirst-quarter prediction and 170,000 b/d from its full-year forecast. We remain cautious about the outlook for oildemand in [the first quarter] due to the expected impact of the new Covid variants, particularly on mobility, theParis-based IEA wrote in its February <em>Oil Market Report</em>. For now the energy watchdog still remainssteadfastly bullish for an oil demand recovery in the second half of the year.International benchmark Brent still finished the week $2.30 per barrel higher, closing at $61.14/bbl Thursday despitea daily slide of 33¢/bbl. US price-pin West Texas Intermediate similarly gained $2.01/bbl to end the week at$58.24/bbl despite losing 44¢/bbl on Thursday. Prior to Thursday’s retreat, both benchmark oil prices had climbedaround 12% since the start of the month, driven primarily by the ability of the Opec-plus producer group to preventnew flows of oil amid the vastly improved price environment.Europe’s jet fuel cargo market didn’t seem to get the memo with premiums enjoying a late-week boost ondrastically lower Mideast arrivals. Brokers reckon just 160,000 metric tons has discharged so far this month, with apossible 770,000 tons still to come and just 300,000 tons currently due in March. Regional vaccination rates arenow highest in the UK at 20% of the population as of Feb. 9, compared to just over 4% across the EU.Governments may be starting to talk about vaccine passports that could restart air travel. But most countries arestill deep in lockdown as new viral strains threaten to trigger another spike in infections and stoke fears thatvaccines may not be effective. Regional air traffic is still cruising at barely a third of pre-pandemic levels, accordingto Eurocontrol’s Feb. 11 market update. The network manager had been expecting almost a three-quarter deficitthis month but put the stronger performance down to increased cargo traffic.Northwest European jet cargoes were pegged $18/ton above ICE gasoil futures at Thursday’s close, up from apremium of around $15 per ton a week ago. The week saw two jet cargo trades in the market-on-close pricingwindow. Swiss trader Vitol sold 30,000 tons into Rotterdam Feb. 18-22 to European supermajor Royal Dutch Shellin Monday’s window at a $14/ton premium to February ICE gasoil futures. French oil company Total went on to sell30,000 tons on board the <em>Peace Victoria</em> and due into Le Havre Feb. 22-28 to regional heavyweight BPin Thursday’s window at $2.75/ton over the Platts c.i.f. cargo mean. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerpedged closer to 1 million tons this week after cargoes discharged from Kuwait and Russia. Tanks are now morethan double year-earlier levels according to Insights Global.US jet fuel markets continued their steep ascent until the oil price rally stalled on Thursday. Outright quotes gained7¢ per gallon on the week as cold weather fired up the mid-distillate complex. Cash prices averaged $1.62/gallonacross the nation or some 10¢ above 30-day levels. Freezing weather lifted demand for heating oil in the Northeast-- the country’s largest regional consumer. Demand in the Midwest and elsewhere surged for kerosene blendstock,which is used to improve the cold-weather properties of diesel. Mid-distillate stocks fell by 1.7 million barrels to161.1 million in the week ended Feb. 5.Refiners kept output steady near the 1.2 million b/d mark, well below year-earlier levels of 1.8 million b/d. But jetusage was erratic, with sales bouncing back to nearly 1.3 million b/d after dipping down to 750,000 b/d in lateJanuary. Some of the volume was channeled into on-airport stocks after winter storms prompted flightcancellations. With air traffic still lagging well-below year-ago levels, US airline executives are urging the WhiteHouse not to impose a testing mandate for domestic flights which they say would further dampen travel demand.The bounce lifted average jet prices across the US to $1.62/gallon -- the highest level in nearly a year. Climbingdiesel futures accounted for nearly all the gain, since jet spreads continued to languish. Gulf Coast jet was tradingat more than 18¢/gallon below March diesel futures, while New York Harbor barrels were trading at 14¢ below thescreen. Los Angeles differentials weakened to a 14¢/gallon discount, even though refinery closures on the WestCoast have increased the region’s dependence on imports. Incoming shipments fell to just 39,000 b/d amid a hiatusin cargo movements across the Pacific.Asian jet fuel differentials hit a two-month high on pre-Chinese New Year holiday trading before markets closed.Swiss trader Vitol bought 180,000 bbl of late-February to early-March loading jet from China's Unipec between Feb.5-10 at a 5¢/bbl premium to benchmark mean of Platts Singapore (MOPS) quotes. That was up sharply from theMOPS minus 10¢/bbl previously traded on Feb. 3 and pushed benchmark price assessments up 16¢/bbl on theshorter week to MOPS minus 5¢/bbl on Feb. 10 -- the firmest since Dec. 8.The rally comes despite a steep drop in Chinese demand for jet fuel after Beijing clamped down on New Yeartravel. China’s scheduled airline capacity plunged by 26.7% in the week of Feb. 8, falling from 12.29 million seats to9 million seats, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. That knocked China off the global top spot for nationalscheduled airline capacity. This week’s numbers are just staggering and highlight how quiet this year’s festivitiesare likely to be, OAG noted. Scheduled capacity in the world's largest Northeast Asia regional jet market fell 21%as a result, while capacity in Southeast Asia ticked 1.2% higher and South Asian traffic rose 1.1%, OAG added.Northeast Asian airline capacity is three times or more the size of the markets in Southeast Asia and South Asia,meaning the combined increase for the two regions is still just a small fraction of the decline in Northeast Asia.

Feb 2021;"Cloudy outlook for stalled jet fuel demand recovery";" February 18 -- Hopes of a speedy aviation recovery this year have been knocked back by global travel restrictionsafter the emergence of new coronavirus variants and a slower than expected vaccination rollout, dimming theoutlook for jet fuel demand and oil prices.Jet fuel suffered the biggest demand decline among oil products as aviation activity collapsed last year and is seenby market participants as one of the main factors influencing 2021 oil demand growth, given the lingeringuncertainties.Almost 10% of total oil demand in OECD countries was for jet fuel in 2019, dropping to 6% in 2020, InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) data shows. By comparison, gasoline demand remained around 30% in both 2019 and 2020.Goldman Sachs last month lowered its forecast for first-quarter global oil demand by 700,000 barrels per day (bpd),or 0.7% of total consumption, mainly because of renewed travel restrictions.EMPTY SKIESAnalysts and traders had expected a swift recovery for jet fuel consumption on the back of a bounce in leisuretravel. However, vaccination programmes have been delayed and the skies remain empty, with thousands of planesgrounded by the pandemic and many airlines pushed to the verge of bankruptcy.""For the short-term, there is still no sign of recovery for jet fuel,"" said a senior jet fuel trader associated with aJapanese refiner.Most traders and analysts now expect the situation to improve only in the second half of the year as vaccine rolloutscontinue and domestic flights pick up. A recovery in international flights, however, is expected to take longer.Long-haul flights burn an average of about 35 times more fuel than regional flights, the IEA says, and areresponsible for more than a third of total fuel used by the aviation sector.Jet fuel demand will remain at about 5.4 and 5.7 million bpd in the first and second quarters respectively, researchconsultancy Energy Aspects projects, far below average global consumption of 7.9 million bpd in 2019.MARGINS AND INVENTORIESIn Asia, jet fuel cracks, or margins, have gained in recent weeks but remain at record lows for the time of year.""Refiners with substantial domestic markets will try to run just enough to produce jet fuel to meet domesticdemand as the international market is still weak,"" one senior jet fuel trader said.In Europe, jet fuel cracks continue to rise, mainly owing to expected heavy refinery maintenance work rather thanstrong demand.Jet fuel held in independent storage in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hub rose in the week toThursday to 983,000 tonnes, almost 110% higher than the same period last year.Global jet fuel floating storage, meanwhile, rose to about 4 million barrels in early February, having dropped from apeak of about 20 million barrels in August 2020 to almost 2.5 million barrels last month, according to dataintelligence firm Kpler.(Graphic: Jet fuel floating storage, https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-OIL/xklpylwjevg/chart.png)The emergence of more contagious variants of the virus has severely affected intercontinental travel, with recoveryexpected to be arduous, which analysts and traders say could be most painful for Middle East refiners that areheavily reliant on such flights.With new refining capacity coming online in the region this year, the refiners have no option but to export more jetfuel to already oversupplied markets.In the United States, airline passenger volumes are still down 65% from pre-pandemic levels, said U.S. industrygroup Airlines for America.American Airlines said in its fourth-quarter report that it is looking at 2021 as ""a year of recovery"" but could notpredict exactly when passenger demand will return.SECOND-HALF UPTURN?Analysts at Wood Mackenzie have their sights set on the back end of 2021 for the jet fuel recovery to kick in.""We expect to see the critical mass vaccinated by the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth quarter,and that's when you will see the pace of jet fuel demand pick up,"" said Suzanne Danforth, Wood Mackenzie'sAmericas markets lead for the oils and refining markets.U.S. refiners raised their jet fuel yields - the percentage of finished product from input of crude oil - towards the endof 2020 and are expected to increase them throughout the year, Danforth said.Pre-pandemic yields of about 10.5% fell to 6.8% last year, she added.But there's no getting away from the uncertainty that clouds the market. U.S. Energy Information Administrationdata showed that U.S. jet fuel demand hit nearly 1.5 million bpd in the week to Jan. 8, its highest since March lastyear, only to drop back to 1.3 million bpd in the week to Feb. 5."
Feb 2021;"Patchy Europe jet kerosene demand erodes differentials";"LONDON (ICIS)--The European jet kerosene market continues to face pressure as the aviation sector struggleswith global travel restrictions and a slower-than-expected coronavirus vaccine roll out.Trading activity remained negligible with limited action in the cargoes and barges, pulling jet differentials to ICEgasoil futures down to early teens, swinging between $10-12/tonne during the week.A downward spiral in differentials was recorded in the last few weeks amid low levels of trades. Offers failed to findsubstantial bids in the open market trading window, because of a lack of buying interest.Still, European jet fuel spot outright values remained supported by firming [1]Brent crude futures which weretrending above $65/bbl mark. Refinery output remains low as margins remain discouraging, as indicated by the jetprompt-month crack spread at $4/bbl.Weekly average values have managed to rise 2-3%, staying steady at pre-pandemic levels. Outright jet cargovalues on a cost, insurance & freight (CIF) northwest Europe (NWE) basis grew to $544.75/tonne on 24 February,up $11.5/tonne from the same time last week.Barge outright values on a free on board (FOB) Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) basis, closed on Tuesday at$544.50/tonne.The market is in contango which typically encourages buying for storage. However, the contango remains narrow,which could take away some of its impact.Overall demand remains lacklustre and warmer weather across parts of Europe has likely led to increasedavailability due to less consumption in the competing market of kerosene for heating fuel.From the supply perspective, refineries have been cautious about accelerating jet fuel output when compared toother oil refined products drawing better margins. Jet fuel crack - a measure for refinery margin - staying at single-digit lows when compared to the highs of $17/bbl average in 2019-2020 and $10/bbl towards the end of 2018.As such, supply-side woes are likely to mount should demand fails to see light of the day with limited respite fromextended maintenance schedules and reduced throughputs.With regional aviation sector failing to rebound at the same pace as seen across other regional markets, especiallyAsia, jet fuel demand is likely to be suppressed for the rest of the quarter.References1. https://subscriber.icis.com/search/news/petchem/news-article-00110608971"
Feb 2021;"Prices Rise Ahead of Opec Crunch Meeting";"Oil futures gained another $3 per barrel despite running out of steam late in the week ahead of a Mar. 4 Opec-plusmeeting where the group will discuss ramping up production. International benchmark Brent closed at $66.88/bblThursday, up $2.95/bbl on the week, while US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate rose $3.01/bbl to endthe week at $63.53/bbl. Opec production restraint has been crucial in driving the recovery in oil prices seen sincelast April and any loosening of the taps could quickly derail the market's bull run.Traders have also bet on a sharp global economic recovery from the pandemic. Oil demand is expected to get backto pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year but jet fuel will be missing from the demand picture for many monthsafter that. Swiss trader Vitol’s global head of research Giovanni Serio told a conference this week that jet fuelbuying was unlikely to get back to pre-Covid-19 levels until sometime next year. Varo Energy CEO Roger Brownput it even later in 2023 or even 2024. This is not just a matter of consumer behavior but the pace of vaccinationswhich are different everywhere so it [jet] will be the last product to recover, Brown explained.Jet cargo premiums were heading back toward single-digits in Europe before a rerouting of Mideast and even localMediterranean production to the US gave the market fresh supply-side support. Trans-Atlantic tanker bookings tocover for storm-ravaged US Gulf Coast Refinery production include the MRs <em>STI Ruby</em> from Greeceand <em>British Cadet</em> from Algeria plus the LR1s <em>Pacific Julia</em> from Kuwait and <em>VelosRuby</em> from Saudi Arabia totaling at least 200,000 metric tons. Sellers are understandably keen to bypassEurope, where air traffic is still down by more than two-thirds on pre-pandemic levels and fuel tanks remain full. Jetstocks were nudging 1 million tons in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp on Feb. 25, according to Insights Global, theirhighest since the end of December and almost 1½ times levels this time last year.Northwest European cargoes were pegged $14.25 per ton over March ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures at Thursday’sclose up from $13.50/ton a week ago and up from barely $10/ton midweek. The week saw three cargo deals all inTuesday's end-of-day window. Vitol paid a $13.50/ton premium to the March ICE gasoil screen for Mar. 5-9delivery, and March plus $13/ton for Mar. 6-10 delivery, into Rotterdam to China's Unipec. BP paid March plus$12/ton for Mar. 7-11 delivery into Le Havre to Royal Dutch Shell the same day. Shell named the LR2 <em>SeaJewel</em> coming from Ruwais in the United Arab Emirates and later offered fuel on board the LR1<em>Sunray</em> from Kuwait’s Mina al-Ahmadi refinery. The plant has just reopened after a major upgrade tomake clean diesel.In one fell swoop the severe winter storm that sidelined more than 4 million barrels per day of US Gulf Coastrefining capacity has eliminated the overhang of refined products caused by Covid-19 demand destruction andtriggered some unusual jet fuel imports from Europe and the Mideast Gulf. Refinery shutdowns cut Gulf Coast jetproduction by 212,000 b/d in the week ending Feb. 19, trimming overall output to 908,000 b/d and opening the doorto 125,000 b/d of imports. Widespread flight cancellations pushed jet sales back below the 1 million b/d mark,however, with US demand still falling 700,000 b/d short of pre-Covid-19 levels. Stocks in the Midwest and on theGulf Coast plunged by 1 million barrels, but were offset by a similar gain on the East Coast. That kept total US jetinventories at 41.2 million bbl -- providing 39.5 days of cover or 11 days more than February last year. The amplejet fuel cushion contrasts with leaner middle distillate tanks, which shed 5 million bbl to reach their lowest level in13 weeks.Strong diesel prices are driving most of the gains in US jet fuel markets as limited airline demand prevents jetdiscounts in most regions from tightening. The March diesel futures contract topped the $1.90 per gallon mark forthe first time in more than a year, pushing outright jet quotes into the $1.73-$1.85/gallon range, more than 20¢above 30-day averages. Jet differentials in the major trading regions spanned an unusually narrow range of 13¢-16¢/gallon below diesel futures, little changed from the previous week. Chicago was the exception after the week-long closure of the Explorer pipeline due to the storm restricted supplies into the Midwest. Chicago jet spreadsjumped by 5¢/gallon from the previous week to just 4.5¢ below April diesel futures, making regional cash rates thehighest in the nation.The Asian jet market softened despite higher arbitrage flows to the US West Coast with an unusually high volumeof trade in the Singapore trading window confirming the downward move. Benchmark Singapore spot pricedifferentials fell to their steepest discount in three months, dipping 38¢/bbl below Singapore quotes on Feb. 24. Aslight recovery to only a 32¢/bbl discount to Singapore quotes by Feb. 25, was still down 15¢/bbl on the week.A total 650,000 bbl of March-loading jet changed hands in the Platts Singapore trading window between Feb. 19-26, an unusually high one-week volume by recent standards. French oil company Total bought all of it with Swisstrader Vitol the biggest seller, offloading 450,000 bbl through the window. European majors Shell and BP each sold100,000 bbl. Jet arbitrage flows from Asia to the US West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii rose by 44,000 tons from theprevious week to 85,000 tons in the week starting Feb. 22, according to data intelligence company Kpler. Of thosevolumes, 44,000 tons were sourced from Taiwan’s Formosa refinery while the remaining 41,000 tons were sourcedfrom South Korean refiner S-Oil’s Ulsan plant. The cargoes are expected to reach the US West Coast between Mar.14-18. European Quarterly Jet Fuel Swaps Quotes Quarter Chg.

Feb 2021;"Airlines, renewables companies push Biden to make air travel greener";"NEW YORK - U.S airlines and renewables companies are lobbying the Biden administration to back a big increasein subsidies for lower-carbon aviation fuel, arguing new incentives are needed to help fight climate change and willalso make their recovery from the pandemic much greener, industry trade groups told Reuters.The push reflects the hefty price that U.S. taxpayers may be asked to pay as President Joe Biden seeks to followthrough on his plan to both decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050 and to help battered industries recover from theeconomic meltdown.Air travel contributes around 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the Air Transport Action Group said. It isprojected to grow rapidly in coming decades if airlines do not quickly switch to ""sustainable aviation fuel.""This is made from biologically-sourced wastes like old cooking oil, animal fat and plant oils and is a much moreexpensive product than traditional jet fuel.The sustainable aviation fuel industry senses a political opening with the Biden administration after four yearsduring which former President Donald Trump downplayed the threats from global warming and backed regulationsthat maximized fossil fuels development.""The difference is we've got an ear now that's much more sympathetic to figuring out near-term solutions to policy,research and development,"" said Bryan Sherbacow, chief commercial officer for low-carbon fuels provider WorldEnergy.The National Air Transportation Association, which represents more than 3,000 companies across the aviationindustry, said it was due to meet with the Federal Aviation Administration this month to sell an incentive forsustainable aviation fuel of up to $2 a gallon, which industry analysts estimate would be one of the priciest fuelincentives in the country.With a Democratic majority in the House of Representative and an evenly split Senate, White House support forlegislation on incentives is pivotal.The FAA said in a statement to Reuters that it could not verify information about specific meetings, though it said itwas a ""strong proponent"" of sustainable aviation fuels.NATA said it is also trying to meet with the Department of Transportation.Airlines for America (A4A), which represents U.S. airline companies, including United, American Airlines andSouthwest, said it has also been in contact with the Biden administration's climate change officials to discussexpanding the sustainable aviation fuel market.Currently, A4A members use only about 1.5 million gallons of green plane fuel in the United States a year, out of atotal commercial jet fuel market that exceeds 620 million barrels annually, based on data from A4A and the EnergyInformation Administration.The price of sustainable aviation fuel can be three or four times higher than traditional jet fuel, making ituneconomical without government support, said Nancy Young, A4A's vice president of environmental affairs.Currently, sustainable aviation fuel producers are eligible for a $1 per gallon subsidy under an existing federalbiodiesel tax credit. The fuel is also eligible for incentives under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard and California'sLow Carbon Fuel Standard, which both encourage clean fuel production by generating tradable credits.U.S. Representative Julia Brownley, a Democrat from California, introduced new legislation in early February thatwould boost those incentives by authorizing $1 billion in federal funding and by creating a blender's tax creditspecific to sustainable aviation fuel.Analysts said a well-thought out incentive structure - even if expensive - could help to decarbonize an industry thatwill have to rely on some form of liquid fuels for decades.""Aviation is likely to be a source of carbon emissions for a very long time,"" said Robert Campbell, head of oilproducts research at Energy Aspects. ""The decarbonization options for aviation are challenging, to say the least.""COMPANIES PLACE BETSSeveral other countries have already proposed sustainable aviation fuel mandates or are exploring them as ameans of addressing increasing carbon output from air travel. A mandate in Norway came into force in January2020, while the Netherlands is set to have one in place by 2023.Globally, more than 250,000 flights have run on sustainable aviation fuel since 2016, while an estimated 10.6million gallons were produced in 2020, the International Air Transport Association said.Several companies are betting on future growth.Chicago-based Boeing, a leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners, for example, has committed to fly with100% sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, it said in January.Meanwhile, Neste, a Finnish oil refiner and renewable fuels producer, said it plans to expand its sustainableaviation fuel global production capability by early 2023 to 510 million gallons per year from 34 million gallonscurrently.While several U.S. petroleum refiners have made capital investments in retrofitting their plants to producerenewable diesel, they are agnostic about legislation regarding tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel, several U.S.refining industry sources told Reuters.So far, only Phillips 66 has announced its intent to produce the fuel at its planned renewable fuels facility in Rodeo,California. Valero, meanwhile, has said it could produce sustainable aviation fuel in the future ""when we need topivot there."" (Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; additional reporting by Laura Sanicola.

Feb 2021;"Signs of healthy recovery unable to prop up crude demand as transport";"LONDON (ICIS)--There are early signs of a healthy recovery in 2021 but the recovery in crude demand will lag astransportation is not set to fully recover any time soon, the producing cartel OPEC said on Thursday.Petrochemicals activity, however, will remain healthy and continue to support demand from crude oil, which hasfound in the industrial sectors an ally to keep a determining role in the global energy mix as transport electrifies incoming decades.Before transport electrifies, however, the gasoline and derivatives used to fuel mobility will still remain somewhatredundant in 2021 as demand from those sectors is not set to recover pre-pandemic levels this year.Travel remains practically at a standstill and as governments battle to contain the spread of the pandemic, with theaviation s jet fuel market in the doldrums, and restrictions to mobility continue denting demand for crude in roadtransport.The transportation sector amounts to around 50% of total crude oil demand, according to OPEC.OPEC expects crude oil demand is forecast to grow by 5.8m bbl/day in 2021, not yet recovering the ground lostduring the pandemic.At 96.1m bbl/day, the expected demand for crude oil will remain far from the pre-pandemic 100m bbl/day of 2019.The historic fall for 2020 stood at 9.7m bbl/day, with global demand at 90.3m bbl/day. Global GDP growth is projected to rebound based on positive developments, particularly in the US, China andIndia in Q1 2020, said OPEC. With regard to oil demand, the negative impact of the containment measures on transportation fuels is expected tocarry over, particularly into Q1 2021, with a stronger rebound in oil demand growth, especially for industrial fuels,forecast in H2 2021.A big chunk of the recovery in crude oil demand this year will come from the industrial sectors, where activity in2020 decreased to a lesser extent than in the 2008-2009 financial crisis.The trend is set to continue in 2021, with demand from industrial sectors remaining healthy and, together with apartial recovery in transport, making up for the 5.8m bbl/day gain in demand for crude this year.OPEC forecasts global growth in 2021 at 4.8%, year on year, sharply up from its previous forecast of 4.4% due tobetter-than-expected economic performances across the globe in the fourth quarter of 2020. drags - OPECAccording to this estimate, the world s economy would recover by the end of this year the pre-pandemic levels,after global GDP fell by 3.9% in 2020, as per OPEC.However, OPEC adopted a more realistic tone as the pandemic could, once again, derail the pace of recovery.The crude cartel is also wary that the post-pandemic economy may not be the same, affecting its core business astransport fuels change and climate policies bite fossil fuels; these factors deserve close monitoring , said OPEC. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, challenging unemployment levels, trade constraints, the pace of vaccinations aswell as the impact of the announced economic stimulus measures [in the US and other major economies] into thereal economy will continue to cause a large degree of uncertainty, it said. Moreover, the ongoing degree of substitution, phasing out of subsidy programmes, the impact of commissioning,delays, and/or closure of downstream projects, as well as programmes for fuel efficiencies, will all require continuedclose monitoring during the course of the year.Earlier on Thursday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) also said the crude oil market's [1]rebalancingremained ""fragile"", despite recent gains in crude oil prices.Crude oil Brent futures were trading comfortably [2]above the $60/bbl mark in European afternoon trading; duringthe pandemic-induced lows of April 2020, Brent [3]touched lows at $19.33/bbl.References1. https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00110605832 2.https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00110605529 3.https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00110498817"
Mar 2021;"European Snapshot: Lower Imports Balance Depleted Jet Fuel Market";"European jet fuel markets ended the year about 60% smaller than their pre-pandemic size. The resurgent virusslashed air traffic flows and pushed December jet demand down below 2 million tons from a summertime peak of2.6 million tons. Refiners produced 1.34 million tons of jet fuel as crude throughput climbed to 41.9 million tons tomeet resurgent demand for road transport fuels. Imports flowed in at diminished levels of 1.5 million tons fromsuppliers in the Middle East, India and South Korea.Jet fuel held in floating storage had mostly been unloaded by December after peaking at 2.4 million tons lastAugust. European stocks held in on-land tanks totaled 11.1 million tons. Spain, the UK and Italy accounted for mostof the surplus versus last year.

Adoption of digital travel passes will make the pre-departure journey more seamless andstress-free for passengers in the post-COVID world, while also delivering a sustainable solution that will allowairport operations to scale up as travel resumes. In future, this verification process can also be used to supportborder control processes to help enable the safe reopening of borders.Cathay Pacific is very proud to have collaborated with the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), The CommonsProject and Prenetics on the trial. This followed a previous successful trial conducted in October last year betweenHong Kong and Singapore with the same partners. Cathay Pacific is also a member of the IATA Travel PassAdvisory Group.Cathay Pacific General Manager Customer Experience and Design Vivian Lo said: “International travel remainssuppressed due to various travel restraints around the world. For borders to reopen fully once again, travellers mayneed to provide COVID-19 test and vaccination records that meet government requirements in order to travel.“We believe that digital travel passes will play an important role in helping facilitate the safe, progressive return ofinternational travel. We have therefore been collaborating with our industry partners to pursue the adoption ofuniversally recognised digital travel passes as we prepare to welcome more passengers onboard our flights. A verybig thank you to our partners who have helped to make the trials a success.”https://news.cathaypacific.com/cathay-pacific-pursues-the-adoption-of-digital-travel-passes-to-facilitate-international-travel# Acquisdata: Up to date business intelligence reports covering developments in the world’s fastest growingindustries www.acquisdata.com ## Reportal: a vast archive of corporate documents from listed companies around the world www.reportaldata.com #Latest ResearchThe impacts of COVID-19 on the global airline industry: An event study approachSakkakom Maneenoop & Suntichai KotcharinAbstractThis study examines the short-term impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on 52 listed airlinecompanies around the world by using event study methodology. The results demonstrate that airline stock returnsdecline more significantly than the market returns after three major COVID-19 announcements were made. Overall,investors react differently during the three selected events. The strongest overreaction is noted in the post-eventperiod of the World Health Organization's and President Trump's official announcements. Moreover, the findingsconfirm that traders in Western countries are more responsive to recent information than the rest of the world.

Given the many operational and economic challenges currently facing the aviationsector, our gradual restoration of passenger traffic, driven primarily by the domestic segment, is being achieved in afinancially prudent manner. Although the loss for the reporting period was to be expected due to the unprecedentedimpact of the pandemic and continued suspension of most of our international operations, it is lower on a quarter-on-quarter basis, at RUB 21.1 billion in the third quarter compared to RUB 35.8 billion in the second quarter.“Though all key business segment posted improved performance in the third quarter, Pobeda’s results deserveparticular attention as virtually the first airline and the only major carrier anywhere in the world to grow passengernumbers in Q3 2020, with traffic up by 12.0% year-on-year, and the load factor recovering to 95%. On the back ofthese strong operational results, the LCC segment delivered robust financial performance, reporting a net profit inboth the third quarter and the first nine months of 2020, thereby underscoring its strength and the resilience of itsbusiness model.“Thanks to growth of passenger numbers in the third quarter, Aeroflot Group increased revenue quarter-on quarterby RUB 59.4 billion to RUB 84.9 billion, while operating costs increased by RUB 37.1 billion to RUB 95.5 billion.EBITDA improved by 22.1 billion RUB compared to the second quarter and amounted to 20.1 bn RUB. Revenuegrowth outpacing the increase in costs even as flight volumes recovered illustrates our balanced approach torestoring capacities, as we sought to strike a balance between passenger numbers and our financial performance,as well as the results of numerous optimisation initiatives and strict cost control.“The low season of fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2021 will remain challenging for all airlines, which arecontinuing to operate in an environment of restrictions on top of the traditional seasonal decline in demand. AeroflotGroup continues to pursue a conservative approach to capacity deployment as well as making seasonaladjustments. We have been able to build up our liquidity thanks to our RUB 80 billion secondary public offering andsecured credit facilities, which include loans with RUB 70 billion of state guarantees. This gives Aeroflot Group theresources it needs to fulfil its financial obligations to partners and restore operational volumes once marketsresume their recovery”.Key Operating HighlightsUsed to measure the percentage of shipments that flew on the same flight they were booked for.

Mar 2021;"Airport traffic bump shows signs of life for jet fuel market";"A pick-up in spring break travel is pointing to the first signs of life in the sputtering jet fuel market, yet a full-fledgedrecovery is still a ways off.In U.S. airports, the number of passengers checking in through security hit the highest in a year this week,according to Transportation Security Administration data. The TSA is consistently seeing more than 1 million peoplea day pass through checkpoints. Traffic was half of that level just two months ago.Jet fuel has proved to be the weakest link in the oil market since the emergence of COVID-19. Lockdowns earlylast year quickly led to travel restrictions, hundreds of parked airliners, and an overwhelming amount of the fuelplanes use with nowhere to put it. Demand for jet fuel plummeted to the lowest on record last summer.""The U.S. is picking up.Potentially, even within Europe, down the line, things will pick up,"" Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy AspectsLtd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""But it's the international travel - the international travel constitutesthe largest portion of jet demand, and I don't think we've still worked out vaccine passports.""Domestic passenger bookings have risen in recent weeks and U.S. airlines plan to respond by adding more flightsto meet demand, according to Airlines for America. But the industry trade group said business still remains downabout 50 per cent in the U.S. from pre-pandemic levels and more than 60 per cent internationally.The U.S. load factor - the average percentage of seats sold per plane - has started to rebound as well among someof the largest domestic carriers, like United Airlines Holdings Inc., American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air LinesInc., according to Bloomberg data.As of now, the recovery is being led by leisure travel rather than business trips, said George Ferguson, senioraerospace and airline analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence ""Most of the bookings are coming through online travelagencies, so it looks like a very price conscious, younger traveller,"" he said. ""A business and international reboundis late this year at best.""To deal with mounting jet fuel stockpiles last year, refiners added the product to diesel and fuel oil to get rid of it,putting markets on unsure footing. A stronger jet fuel market is key to the oil market's overall recovery.Consumption of jet fuel in the U.S. has held above 1 million barrels a day since October, a marked improvementfrom the end of May 2020 when demand was around 600,000 barrels a day.Still, the aviation product needs to climb much closer in value to that of diesel to signal true health, said ThomasFinlon, chief operating officer at Brownsville GTR, a trading and logistics firm in Houston.Gulf Coast jet fuel traded at about 17 cents a gallon below diesel Friday, compared with a spread of about 5 centsin early 2020.The three largest cash markets for jet fuel - Houston, New York and Los Angeles - have yet to reflect the strengthof the increased airport traffic.

Mar 2021;"European jet fuel continues to buck market trends";"London (ICIS)--European spot jet kerosene prices continue to resist falling significantly as the impact of waningmarket fundamentals have been offset by the rally in upstream Brent crude and ICE gasoil futures, deferringregional progress towards the roll out of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), industry sources said.While the stringent travel restrictions limit the spread of coronavirus and seasonal slowdowns continue to suppressjet fuel demand, little optimism reigns around the Q2 summer holiday period and vaccination programmes.PRICE RALLY FIZZLES OUT After hitting pre-pandemic levels late last month, greater stagnation has beenrecorded, as jet kerosene spot values stay rangebound and differentials to ICE gasoil futures fail to recover fromthe mid-teens in the absence of trading.Even though monthly averages have been firming against 2020 levels, demand-side support remains lacklustre,which raises uncertainty around the sustainability of the current rally in outright values.The continued rally in upstream Brent crude futures, which neared $70/bbl at the start of this week following newsof an attack on the key Saudi oil terminal on 7 March, before settling at $69/bbl on Tuesday 8 March, has filteredthrough to gasoil and other downstream markets.That said, the prompt-month crack spread against rolling Brent remains under pressure. It fell further to $3.15/bbl,retreating from $3.6/bbl seen last week and $4/bbl towards the close of last month.Northwest Europe CIF jet spot values have been at their highest since late January 2020, standing at $565/tonneon 5 March before receding by $10/tonne as crude corrected downwards.EU AVIATION IN THE DOLDRUMS The start of this year has been rather tough for most of the European carriersas new travel restrictions returned in the month of January, curtailing any demand pull for aviation fuel from thesector.According to IATA, European carriers underperformed other regions as the pace of vaccinations being rolled outwas slower than expected, increasing the risk to summer travel and keeping passenger confidence subdued.Latest data from CAPA (Centre for Aviation, part of the Aviation Week Network) suggests that Europe has 7.2mseats in the week commencing 1 March as against 28.3m in 2019, down 75%.CAPA analysis further highlights that Europe has been the worst-performing region for four months, especially sincemid-Oct 2020 pulled it to the bottom of the regional league table, which is ranked by the percentage decline incapacity versus 2019.In this light, any upswing in European jet fuel prices is likely to be supported by upstream strength and reducedrefinery output alongside negligible imports. What is certain is that all eyes remain on demand potentially picking upin the air travel business ahead of the summer holiday period as Q2 approaches.Focus article by Shruti Salwan"
Mar 2021;"European Jet Markets Take Suez Blockage in Stride";"Cutting off Europe’s lifeline jet fuel imports would have sent cargo premiums sky high in the days before Covid-19.But the blocked Suez Canal caused barely a stir in jet markets this week with the region’s airline demand stillfeeble and increasingly non-urgent imports already plying the longer route around Africa ( related ).Ongoing attempts to move the stranded 400 meter-long container ship <em>Ever Given </em>were disruptingcanal traffic for a third day Thursday, amid warnings the rescue effort could take weeks if the ship needs to beunloaded. The ship is now beached on the bank of the canal rather than blocking the main waterway, but canaltraffic is still regularly suspended while tugboats attempt to refloat it. The ship ran aground on Mar. 23 with highwinds thought to have compounded engine problems.Traders say most Mideast and Asian jet fuel tankers coming to Europe were already bypassing the Suez Canaland taking the long route around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope before the incident. At least five vessels are currentlyen route from the Mideast Gulf to Lome in Togo, where they have the option of being sold into West Africa or evendiverting across the Atlantic before continuing their journey to Europe. Owners are deliberately adding up to 16days to journey times in the hope some airline fuel buying might appear by the time they arrive -- with a $3 per tonper month contango helping pay for it. ""Cape [traffic] was happening anyway,"" says a London-based jet fuel trader.""I don't see an impact on jet here, it's not exactly needed,"" he adds.European flight numbers are still barely a third of pre-Covid levels with travel restrictions tightening as the spread ofnew variants and dismal vaccination rates across the EU trigger a third wave of the deadly virus. Hopes that theEU’s Digital Green Certificate could allow flights to resume this summer are already starting to fade. A growingnumber of jet traders say they have already written off Europe's peak summer demand season for a second year (JFI Jan.8'21 ).Some jet fuel tankers were among the 15 or so product tankers thought to be caught up in the disruption byThursday. Brokers flagged the LR2 <em>Pacific A. Dorodchi</em> bringing jet from Oman for Royal Dutch Shelland the LR1 <em>Nautical Deborah</em> chartered by Swiss trader Trafigura to take jet from the United ArabEmirates to Rotterdam stuck at the southern end of the canal Thursday. A third jet tanker, the <em>Navig8Success</em> also chartered by Trafigura, is still due to arrive over the weekend with BP's LR2 <em>AlpineAqualina</em> set to arrive next week. Tanker tracker Kpler has so far identified just one jet fuel tanker, Shell'sLR2 <em>Pacific Nafsika </em>from Kuwait, changing its route from Suez to the Cape.Prior to Covid-19, Europe got more than three-quarters of its lifeblood jet fuel imports from countries East of Suez.Those crucial volumes met almost a third of airline fuel demand ( JFI Mar.19'21 ). Most of it came through the SuezCanal as booming airline fuel demand and a steadily backwardated jet market meant traders were often racingagainst time. The main exception to that traffic was jet loaded onto newly built very large crude carriers that are toobig for the canal.Trade patterns changed last year when East of Suez imports crashed 42% to 10.5 million tons in response toCovid-19 demand destruction and the market flipped into a stockpiling contango. Market watchers reckon aroundhalf of the East-West flow went via the Cape last year as traders sought to postpone its arrival in Europe for as longas possible. Overflowing tanks left a record 2.7 million tons of jet fuel parked in the English Channel last August (JFI Oct.5'20 ).Most of the other product tankers currently stuck in South Suez anchorage are carrying ultra-low sulfur diesel(ULSD). But Europe’s diesel market showed similar nonchalance with cargo differentials falling immediately afterthe Suez news. East of Suez suppliers made up less than a third of Europe’s total diesel imports, which aredominated by Russia. Prior to the pandemic, they met barely 7% of regional demand.Two naphtha vessels were also blocked at the northern end of the canal en route to South Korea and Japan. Threeother tankers were waiting to carry fuel oil from Europe to the Mideast and Singapore.Kerry Preston, London"
Mar 2021;"Higher costs, pandemic slowdown hinders sustainable aviation fuel roll-out";"London(ICIS)--Regional progression of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) roll-outs have been gaining pace albeitslowly as high fuel costs and the pandemic slowdown pose major challenges, industry sources said.Consistent efforts have been made to consume more SAF in flying operations, which can aide in bringinggreenhouse gas emissions down by at least 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. But it costs four to five timesmore, which poses headwinds for the currently struggling aviation market.A major jet fuel trader pointed out that the airline operators have to see how sustainable SAF is in terms of costs,and the industry needs to have respective regional governments support to leverage the opportunity.Some airlines are under greater pressure to agree to environmental terms in order to receive bailouts from theirrespective governments.The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) provides an incentive to aircraft operators to use SAF that complieswith the sustainability criteria defined in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), by attributing them zero emissionsunder the scheme.As per the policy, the use of SAF thereby reduces an aircraft operator s reported emissions, and the number of ETSallowances it has to purchase. This provides a financial incentive for aircraft operators to use SAF instead ofconventional aviation fuels.That said, headwinds persist from a cost perspective given that SAF in Europe is currently priced at least four tofive times higher when compared to jet Rotterdam values, which values it around $2,000-2,500/tonne, industrysources pointed.This has made accessibility to SAF regionally more crucial as freight costs are only likely to prove detrimental to theadaption.Interestingly, European spot jet kerosene prices have managed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels largely trackingthe rally in upstream Brent crude and ICE gasoil futures, despite waning market fundamentals.At the same time, coronavirus has completely jittered aviation demand with most airlines still operating under 50%of their capacity, with revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) staying at the lows of 72-75% of 2019 levels since thestart of the year. in EuropeThe pandemic has surely derailed the financial position of most airlines with the latest Air Financial Monitor of theInternational Air Transport Association (IATA), suggesting further losses recorded by airlines in Q4 financial results,albeit smaller than Q3 aided by cost cutting measures and robust cargo revenues.That said, airlines are still expected to continue to burn cash throughout 2021 as the recovery in travel demand isdelayed to the second half of the year, IATA suggests.Despite the same, SAF policies are gaining attention, with some of the major airline operators amongst KLM,Lufthansa and Ryanair testing flights to reduce carbon emissions.The European Commission is drawing up targets for airlines to use a minimum share of SAF to curb the sector splanet-warming CO2 emissions.Undoubtedly the airline industry is currently concentrating on surviving challenges caused by the coronavirus crisis,yet sustainability remains at the top of their agendas consistent supply and cost factors pose threat."
Mar 2021;"Just recovered from pandemic slump, record prices send fuel demand";"Record prices have begun crushing demand for fuels that had almost fully recovered from the pangs of thepandemic.Petrol sales contracted 2% in February over last year after growing 6.3% in January and 9.3% inDecember. Diesel sales collapsed 8.6% in February over last year after narrowing their decline to 2.2% in Januaryand 2.8% in December.February data cover sales by state-run oil retailers, which control about 90% of the domesticfuel retail market. The demand for jet fuel was 40.6% lower while that for cooking gas grew 7.6%, as per statecompany executives.Part explanation of weaker sales of petrol and diesel lies in shorter February this year, whichhad 28 days as against 29 last year.Industry executives blame record prices as the bigger reason for the demand contraction.""Let's not forget that theeconomy is still not out of the woods. People are still worried about their income and cautious about spending andso they may be already cutting on unnecessary fuel expenditure,"" said an industry executive.Petrol and dieselprices have risen by about Rs 9 per litre in three months, triggering warnings by the Reserve Bank of India andeconomists of the inflationary effect it could have on the economy that's trying to shake off the recessionary effectsof the pandemic.Fuel price hikes follow a two-thirds increase in crude oil prices in the international market in threemonths. An artificial supply cut by key producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, cheap money supply acrossdeveloped economies, wider vaccine rollout and rebounding economies have together contributed to the dramaticrecovery in the oil prices that had fallen to under $20 last April. Big blame for the steep prices also rests with thegovernment, which sharply raised taxes last year when oil prices collapsed but is unwilling to roll them back now.Central and state taxes comprise about 60% of the fuel's retail prices. The Centre hasn't yet signalled itswillingness to cut taxes while some states have begun slashing them.Fuel demand growth year-over-year*Feb 21had only 28 days compared to 29 days in Feb 20.

Mar 2021;"Another fuel increase is loathing this weekend, due to tax and oil rise";"Fuel prices would rise again in the coming hours by more than 3% for the rise of crude oil internationally and theslow but steady devaluation of weight, adjustment in domestic taxes and biofuels as a local context.This Friday they will climb $1.98 per litre of naphthas and $1.23 for diesel, according to a table published by theFederal Public Revenue Administration (AFIP).At the close of this edition, the Government had not postponed this increase. According to EconoJournal, theMinistry of the Economy is working on a scheme to modify quarterly fuel tax adjustments.In addition, private oil companies expected to learn about YPF's movements to move to the public the biofuels '1.9'(1.9 per cent in bioethanol and 3.6 per cent in biodiesel) that have been applied since 1 March and to recovermargins in the refining sector, which declined as a result of currency depreciation and the higher purchase price ofcrude oil domestics.Refiners purchased the Medanito oil barrel (produced in Neuquén) at between $51 and $53 for use in March, andsome contracts were frozen for three months, with the expectation that the government will enable a path ofincreases in suppliers, which would accumulate by 15% until May.As El Cronista anticipated, the producers (Vista, Pluspetrol, Tecpetrol and Sinopec) agreed with the refiners(Raízen and Trafigura) the commercial terms privately and always with the intention that the Government shouldnot intervene the sector through decrees or regulations, to preserve the possibility of exporting the remainingbalances after the full supply of the domestic market.Since August last year, when the price freeze that took effect during the first eight months of Alberto Fernández'spresidency was released, fuels rose by 40% in six months.YPF's business strategy was spearheaded by its CEO, Sergio Affronti, who seeks to keep dollar prices fromdelayed and closely follow the exchange rate variation.This allowed it to oxygenate the box in the last quarter of the year and cut some of the oil company's losses in oneof the worst years in Argentina's economic history and the worst in the company.At the same time, the increases give YPF the funds needed to invest about $2.7 billion this year, 74% more thanthe 1554 million capex u$s earmarked for 2020, with nearly 80% of revenue generating them from sales of fuelssuch as diesel, naphtha and jet fuel in the local market.Meanwhile, demand at service stations did not rebound in January, for a restricted tourist season.The owners of the expendio mouths ensure that there is a lack of an increase of between 13% and 15% in prices,which must be combined with what consumers can afford. Although most stations are operating at a loss, no massive closures are expected in the coming months,depending on what they count in the sectoral pattern chambers."
Mar 2021;"Global economy to rebound in 2021, says report";"After a major downturn of the global economy in 2020 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and despite renewedlockdowns in some parts of the world, the global economy is expected to rebound in 2021, a new report said.Several vaccines have been approved and are in the process of being rolled out, allowing for a gradual reversal oflockdown measures, said the report titled ""Global Economic Outlook - February 2021"" by Atradius, a globalprovider of trade credit insurance, surety and collections services.Meanwhile fiscal and monetary support remains essential while countries return to normal economic life. There isconsiderable uncertainty around our baseline forecast, given the possibility of a delayed recovery, which may occurif there is a stretched wave of global infections. This would significantly reduce GDP growth in 2021 and effectivelypush the recovery into 2022.Key points• As countries gradually emerge from their lockdowns, we expect global GDP to recover by 5.0% in 2021, followinga 3.9% contraction in 2020.• Prospects for global trade in 2021 are good, following a revival of trade growth in the second half of last year.Global trade growth is expected to rebound by 7-8% in 2021, after a contraction of similar size in 2020.• After economic downturns in 2020, advanced markets as a group see growth rebounding by 3.9% in 2021, after a5.0% decline in 2020. The pace of recovery deviates, but most advanced markets do not completely recover in2021 from the GDP contraction they experienced last year.• In the Eurozone, economies continue to be in relatively strict lockdowns. A partial recovery of 4.2% is likely tooccur in 2021 and only in 2022 is activity expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. National governments areexpected to continue fiscal stimulus well into 2021.• The virus poses serious downside risks to the US economy in 2021, but economic growth is forecast to reboundas the rollout of vaccination allows lockdown measures to be gradually reversed. Moreover, the new governmentreduces policy uncertainty, and a new major stimulus plan for the economy is in the making.• In Japan, infections were brought under control in the first half of 2020. As a result, the economy is off to a goodstart in 2021, though it will not fully recover from the recession of last year. If held, the Tokyo Olympics will providea temporary boost to GDP in 2021.• Many emerging market economies (EMEs) are still at a critical stage in the health crisis, though there are largedifferences between countries and regions. Asia is head of the curve in controlling the number of infections.Emerging markets as a group are forecast to grow by 6.3% in 2021, following a 1.9% contraction in 2020. –TradeArabia News Service"

Apr 2021;"Rising US travel demand boosting gasoline, jet fuel markets - Valero";"HOUSTON (ICIS)-- Rising US travel demand is encouraging gains in demand for gasoline and jet fuel, Valero saidin its earnings presentation.Valero executives said that the gasoline recovery has gone well since the height of the pandemic, due to acombination of increased vaccination rates and stimulus bills.As Americans have more disposable income, consumers are expected to spend it on trips rather than buying itemssince they have been in a year of lockdowns and movement limitations, also expecting to boost jet fuel andgasoline demand.The company added that domestic export markets are picking up despite rising coronavirus cases around theworld.Diesel demand is almost fully recovered, the company said, largely driven by strong diesel demand in theagricultural markets.During the pandemic, Valero said it expected jet fuel demand to lag the recovery seen in other products but recentpassenger travel numbers provided by the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have provided someoptimism.Resumption of some flight paths by airlines and the recalling of pilots and crew has also shown the recent increasein demand recovery, with Valero saying that their jet fuel demand is at 76% of pre-pandemic levels.International air travel is expected to recover slower than domestic due to ongoing international flight restrictions."
Apr 2021;"Global economic confidence rebounds among accountants";"Accountants expressed much higher confidence in the economy during the first quarter of this year compared tolast year, especially in North America, according to a new survey.Thesurvey, by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and the Institute of Management Accountants,polled more than 1,000 senior accountants and finance professionals around the world, and found the biggestquarterly jump in confidence in a decade, thanks to increasing supplies of vaccines and continuing fiscal stimulusfrom many governments. The ACCA and IMA's Global Economic Conditions Survey saw a nearly 30-point jump inthe confidence index globally and more than 40 points for North America in the first quarter of 2021, compared tothe fourth quarter of 2020. However, the two ""fear"" indices in the survey, which measure concern that customersand suppliers could go out of business, offered contrasting messages. Fear that customers would go out ofbusiness declined significantly while fear that suppliers would do so rose slightly higher. But both factors remain atrelatively high levels, underscoring the high level of uncertainty that remains in the world economy.The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in recent months have helped improve economic confidence in many parts ofthe world. However, the growing number of COVID-19 variants that seem to spread more easily has also led touncertainty and some European countries have been forced to retreat on their reopening plans. In many parts of theworld, access to vaccines remains severely limited. Accountants in Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East didnot register as much of an increase in economic confidence as those in North America and Asia.""This crisis is different as its root cause is health and not economic,"" said IMA vice president of research and policyRaef Lawson in a statement Monday. ""For now, global COVID-19 infections are high relative to the vaccinationrate, so risks remain significant. But the huge government support provided to both households and companiesover the last year leaves both well-placed to resume spending once the health crisis is over. There are likely to bepermanent changes in the pattern of spending and other long-term economic consequences of the COVID crisis.""Economic activity indicators for orders, capital spending and employment all increased to some extent in the firstquarter of this year, according to the survey, echoing the level of confidence in the fourth quarter of 2019 before thespread of the COVID-19 pandemic.""Having suffered the biggest recession for several decades in 2020, the global economy is on course for arelatively quick rebound,"" said ACCA chief economist Michael Taylor in a statement. ""The good news is thatvaccination plans with continued policy support are on course to lift the global economy out of the COVID abyssthis year.""The report acknowledged that vaccination rates vary significantly across different countries, and vaccination canreplace lockdown measures as a way to control COVID-19, allowing economic conditions to return to normal.https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/global-economic-confidence-rebounds-among-accountants"

Use of bonded fuel forinternational flights totaled 88,000 b/d, while domestic usage shrank to 129,000 b/d. Tokyo's decision to baroverseas visitors from the summer Olympic Games will put a damper on international travel and jet demandthrough the summer months.Japanese refiners ratcheted back jet fuel output to just 91,000 b/d to contain a supply overhang. Another 40,000b/d of imports helped fill the limited needs for bonded fuel. That disciplined approach to balance the market keptstocks 17% below the year-ago mark.

Airline buying is unlikely to recover until highervaccination rates allow the EU to launch its Green Digital Certificate allowing regional air travel without quarantine.Fuel suppliers were caught on the hop again with local refiners already ramping up runs to meet resurgent demandfor road and heating fuels.

Apr 2021;"European jet fuel demand remains low as coronavirus restrictions return";"LONDON (ICIS)--Optimism in the European spot jet kerosene market has been dented by the return of lockdownsand travel restrictions in the region, which will affect the rebound in demand expected during the summer holidayperiod.Prices are under downwards pressure from softening Brent crude futures, evaporating demand and from airlinesalready being well-stocked with fuel.Outright values on a CIF (cost, insurance and freight) NWE (Northwest Europe) basis have softened by 11% frommid-March levels, and were assessed at $508/tonne at the market close on Wednesday 7 April.The number of trades concluded was low in the past week due to the Easter holiday, despite a higher number ofbids and offers seen during the week.Jet differentials to ICE gasoil futures have exhibited a diverging trend, with cargo premiums lowering to the lowteens while barge premiums have entered the 20s.Market optimism has continued to be dented by a resurgence in the number of cases of coronavirus, which has ledmany European nations, including Italy, Germany and France, to reimpose lockdowns.By contrast, the UK is gradually easing its restrictions after a tough lockdown imposed late last year, havingvaccinated on a large scale and reduced its infection rate. Restrictions on foreign travel for leisure remain, however.Industry sources suggested demand for aviation fuel will remain low in the near term. A major aviation fuel buyersaid not only did it have enough fuel but had high stocks and would not need to buy unless air travel starts to pickup pace.The market is said to be balanced to long, with fears mounting of length returning to the market as travelrestrictions return and curb demand for both jet and gasoil.The jet fuel market continues to be in strong contango, although the prompt-month crack spread against rollingBrent remains at lows of $2.90/bbl.Stock levels in the key Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) hub dropped by 10% in the week to 1 April,according to data from PJK International, although this still has not encouraged buying.DELAY IN RECOVERY OF AVIATION DEMANEuropean aviation demand remains in a slump after being the hardest hit regions in terms of passenger demandwhen compared with the US and Asia.According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), European carriers recorded an 89.0% decline intraffic in February 2021 compared with February 2019. This was substantially worse than the 83.4% decline inJanuary 2021 compared with January 2019.Even though global new COVID-19 cases were on a downward trend in February, IATA emphasised they remainedworryingly high in markets such as Europe and Latin America, which had a knock-on effect on their aviationperformance.CAPA (Centre for Aviation) said that after operating only 27% of 2019 seat capacity in Q1 2021, Europe's airlinesare currently projecting further caution for April 2021, based on OAG schedules.Europe's seat count was down by 70.6% in the week of 29 March 2021, which marked the start of the 2021 summerseason.CAPA further suggested that if Europe aviation demand continues to lag behind other regions as new lockdownsand new variants of COVID-19 emerge, this is unlikely to change soon.However, a bounce back for Europe to more than 50% of 2019 levels is projected for May 2021, rising to 77-78% inJuly and August 2021, CAPA projected.The rebound is mainly attributed to the summer holiday season, although industry optimism remains cautious aboutan upswing in demand for aviation fuel.Focus article by Shruti Salwan"
Apr 2021;"Prices Climb After Suez Mini Crisis Resolved";"Oil prices briefly rallied alongside equities after the Suez Canal finally reopened. The giant container ship <em>EverGiven</em> was finally dislodged Mar. 29 after blocking the waterway linking Europe to Asia for six days andcausing a huge buildup of ships. Tanker-tracker Kpler pegged the backlog at 450 vessels, including 30 crude and47 refined product tankers, stuck at both ends of the canal when the <em>Ever Given</em> was freed and warnedit would take several days to clear. Around 300 vessels were still stuck late on Wednesday with delays set to lastseveral more days as priority was given to container ships. The Suez Canal normally handles around 50 vessels aday.The market's focus has already turned back to fresh Covid-19 demand destruction and how producer group Opecand its allies might react at their Apr. 1 meeting. International benchmark Brent ended the short trading week at$63.54 per barrel Wednesday, still up $1.59/bbl on the week, while US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediategained 60¢/bbl to close at $59.16/bbl. Previous Opec-plus output cuts have helped push oil prices within a whiskerof pre-Covid-19 levels but no major changes are expected to come out of Thursday's meeting. Inaction comes asmuch of Europe heads into a third round of demand-destroying Covid-19 lockdowns. France has just announced amonth-long national shut down, including a ban on nonessential travel, starting Apr. 5.Two of the jet fuel tankers caught up in last week’s Suez Canal blockage had made it through by Thursday. RoyalDutch Shell’s LR2 <em>Pacific A. Dorodchi</em> and Trafigura’s LR1 <em>Nautical Deborah</em> are on theirway to Northwest Europe leaving three ships still stuck at anchor -- the <em>Navig8 Success</em>, <em>AlpineAqualina</em> and <em>Talara</em> -- holding a combined 200,000 metric tons of jet fuel. The majority of jetcargoes were already heading around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope with West Africa proving a hotspot for floatingstorage while traders wait for buyers to appear. Swiss trader Vitol was offering fuel from the LR2 <em>LakeStars</em>, currently sat in Lome anchorage offshore Togo, in Europe’s end-of-day pricing window last week.The potential gap in imports supported Northwest European jet cargo premiums which nudged a $19 per tonpremium to ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures at Wednesday's close, up from $17/ton at the end of last week. Flightnumbers are starting to increase thanks mainly to a busy air cargo sector with the deficit compared to pre-pandemic2019 levels narrowing from 66% to 62% in the last two weeks. Cargo flights are now 9% above pre-pandemic levelsbut EU vaccination rates need to seriously pick up before passenger traffic can even hope to restart. Barely 15% ofthe EU’s population had been jabbed by Mar. 30, compared to over 50% in the UK.US jet fuel markets tightened with a spurt in demand to 1.36 million barrels per day -- a 30% jump from the priorweek and the highest level since early January. Air traffic is picking up as vaccine rates accelerate and more stateslift restrictions. The outlook for summer flying has improved, with hopes that more domestic leisure flightscompensate for the loss of business and international travel. American Airlines reported that domestic bookingswere now back to 90% of their pre-Covid-19 levels.Refinery output continues to climb with a rise in utilization rates to 84% of capacity. Production reached 1.14 millionb/d with another 248,000 b/d of imports flowing into the country. Relatively high US prices are drawing cargoesacross the Pacific. The Colonial Pipeline has been operating at reduced flow rates since the February stormsknocked out 50% of US Gulf Coast refining capacity. Delayed shipments into the East Coast lifted New York Harborjet differentials to 14¢ below May diesel futures, up from a 17¢ discount in the previous week. Chicago prices arestill the highest in the country due to the February closure of the Explorer Pipeline, with a narrow discount of 6.5¢keeping outright quotes at $1.70/gallon.Asian jet markets weakened further as Vitol continued its long streak of selling in the Singapore trading window.The benchmark Singapore spot price differential dropped by 8¢/bbl from Mar. 25 to a discount of 60¢/bbl toSingapore quotes on Mar. 31 -- its weakest level in five months. A total of 100,000 barrels of April-loading jet tradedfrom Mar. 26 to Apr. 1 in the Platts Singapore trading window. Vitol sold the volumes at a discount of 60¢/bbl toSingapore quotes on Mar. 26 to BP. This marks the seventh week in a row that Vitol has sold jet in the window.Prompt jet demand was boosted by higher air traffic in both Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia.

Apr 2021;"Europe: Suez Blockage Highlights Jet Demand Destruction";"The six-day closure of the Suez Canal on Mar. 23-29 shone a spotlight on Europe's Covid-19-ravaged oil productsmarkets. Naphtha and fuel oil, which are dependent on the waterway to export European products to Asia and theMiddle East, saw prices spike. Jet fuel and diesel markets, which rely on imports in the opposite direction, barelyflinched. Cutting off Europe’s lifeline of jet fuel imports would have sent cargo premiums sky high, to the level in thedays before Covid-19. More than three-quarters of Europe’s jet imports came from countries East of Suez in 2019to meet almost a third of airline fuel demand.Vastly reduced Mideast and Asian jet fuel imports were already heading the longer way around Africa’s Cape ofGood Hope even though Europe's airline fuel demand remains in tatters. Flight numbers are barely a third of pre-Covid-19 levels, prompting arbitrage players to try their luck around the Cape. As well as giving Europeanpurchases more time to appear, cargoes can be more easily diverted to West African or US markets. Europe's ownaviation industry fortunes now depend on the EU’s Green Digital Certificate, which could allow a restart of air travelin time for the peak summer holiday season ( OMI Jan.20'21 ).The reaction to the Suez mini-crisis was similarly subdued in Europe’s market for ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD)with plenty of fuel still coming from Russia and traders more focused on re-exports to the US and the prospect ofnew demand-destroying lockdowns in Europe. Suez traffic mainly from Saudi Arabia and India only met around 7%of European diesel demand in 2019, although flows had been rising before the pandemic. Rising Covid-19 infectionrates mean much of mainland Europe is heading back into lockdown with fuel demand set to fall. Commentatorsthink a 50% vaccination rate is needed before fuel buying can recover ( related ). That milestone has been reachedin the UK, but rates are still just 22% in the EU.Russian ULSD loadings are back to pre-Covid levels from Primorsk, with almost 1.6 million metric tons fixed forApril. East of Suez diesel flows are picking up with 700,000 tons expected in March, including 150,000 tons delayedby Suez. ULSD exports from Europe to the US hit 400,000 tons in March as winter storms hit the very US GulfCoast refiners that normally supply Europe ( OMI Mar.19'21 ). The reverse arbitrage has been mostly open sincelast November, but March set a new record for net flows. Only a single 40,000-ton tanker plied the usual US toEurope trans-Atlantic route. Exports, along with the Suez disruption, has helped clear some of Europe’s dieseloverhang with gasoil tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp down to a 12-month low but still plentiful at 2.3 milliontons on Apr. 8, according to Insights Global.Booming export sales to the US propelled European gasoline margins to their highest since November 2019. Abumper 1.5 million tons of fuel headed trans-Atlantic in March as traders rushed to cash in on US refinery restartproblems following last month’s freak winter storms ( related ). Heavy European traffic to the US opened the doorfor Mideast and Asian barrels into West Africa. Traders said Nigerian buying is particularly strong at the momentfollowing a new round of crude-for-product swap deals.

Apr 2021;"ECONOMICS: Global Economic Recovery Continues, But Uncertainty";" While the world economy has recovered from the COVID-19 crisis faster than was expected six months ago dueto a strong policy response and the distribution of vaccines, uncertainty and inequity within and across countriesremain, the International Monetary and Financial Committee said in a statement after their biannual meeting.""(T)he prospects for recovery are highly uncertain and uneven within and across countries due to varying policyspace, different economic structures and rigidities, preexisting vulnerabilities, and uneven access to vaccines,"" thegroup said in their post-meeting communique.The group emphasized the need for continued policy support and for cooperation to accelerate the production anddistribution of vaccines.""We will maintain our policy support, tailored to country circumstances, until constraints on economic activity easemeaningfully, continuing to prioritize health spending and assistance for the most vulnerable, while preserving long-term fiscal sustainability,"" they said. ""Where appropriate, monetary policy should remain accommodative, in linewith central banks' mandates.""The committee members said they will continue to watch and address, if needed, risks to financial stability, as wellas cooperate to reduce excessive global imbalances to support sustainable global growth.Speaking of the international monetary system's stability, the group said that ""exchange rates reflect underlyingeconomic fundamentals"" and that ""exchange rate flexibility can facilitate the adjustment of our economies. ""Wewill refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes.""The G-20 group made similar comments on foreign exchange Wednesday.The IMFC called on the IMF to move forward with its proposal for a new Special Drawing Rights allocation of $650billion to help meet the global need for reserves, while also increasing the transparency and accountability of theprogram, in line with the request from the G-20 nations."

It said the $1.9trillion stimulus package in the United States played a role in that improved outlook.""The upward revision reflects additional fiscal support in a few large economies, the anticipated vaccine-poweredrecovery in the second half of 2021, and continued adaptation of economic activity to subdued mobility,"" the reportsaid.In the report, the United States' economy was projected to grow 6.4% this year and 3.5% in 2022 while China'seconomy was expected to expand 8.4% in 2021 and 5.6% the year after. India's economy, after losing 8% in2020, was expected to grow 12.5% in 2021 and 6.9% in 2022.The report also predicted France's economy to grow 5.8% this year, Britain's economy by 5.3%, Canada by 5%and Germany's by 3.6%.The report said employment levels of younger and lower-skilled workers will continue to be affected since thepandemic accelerated the move to automation for some of those positions.

May 2021;"Europe Jet Fuel: latest market developments";"LONDON (ICIS)--Lack of buying interest and ample supply amid lingering travel restrictions across the region haskept the European jet kerosene market suppressed. However, outright values were supported by firming upstreamBrent crude futures.Prolonged delays in the reopening of borders by some European nations has dented recovery in the regionalaviation industry, which serves as a proxy for jet fuel demand as it is heavily reliant on international travel.PRICING Outright values on a CIF (cost, insurance and freight) NWE (Northwest Europe) basis edged up to$573.75/tonne at close of market on Tuesday 11 May, up from $568.75/tonne a week prior.This week prices moved slightly up by 2-3% on average, as limited action was recorded. Any upswing wasattributed to greater steadiness in upstream Brent crude futures, which hovered around $68/bbl for most of theweek.The prompt-month jet fuel crack spread against rolling Brent crude futures was heard firming to $5/bbl, withdifferentials to ICE gasoil futures largely static.PREVAILING MARKET SENTIMENTS A market source described the situation as really frustrating, commentingthat things could take a while to return to normal, as the industry continues to face extremely low levels of demand.Added to this, current availability in the market is ample, despite reduced refinery output.LOOKING AHEAAmid the summer maintenance turnaround period, supply is likely to remain ample, with refineries insufficientlyincentivised to increase their operating rates. At the same time, inflows are not yet sufficient to offset demand-sidewoes.On the upside, many European nations are easing their international travel restrictions, with slow yet steadyprogress in vaccine roll outs encouraging passenger confidence.Compared with the Americas and Asia, Europe has been a weak performing region as it relies heavily oninternational travel, which has been disrupted by stricter quarantine rules and high testing costs.The rest of the second quarter, traditionally a peak travel season, is unlikely to see any major rebound in demandfor aviation fuel, although some relief is anticipated as players prepare for travel to pick up slightly during the peaksummer season."
May 2021;"As Oil Demand Creeps Up, Europe's Refiners Get Hope of Recovery";"(Bloomberg) - Whether it's more traffic on the roads, brighter economic readings, or persistently strong freightactivity, Europe's battered oil refineries are finally looking at some relief from Covid-19 and the devastation itwrought on petroleum demand.A measure for the profit plants make from turning crude oil into diesel has doubled since late March, a bullish signalthat's all the more important in Europe because the continent's refiners churn out twice as much diesel as they dogasoline. Oil traders report that the region's crude oil demand is also picking up again.Even in jet fuel, the industry's problem child since Covid-restrictions hit global aviation, there are tentative signsthat the gloom is beginning to clear. When the pandemic hit, it destroyed fuel demand and hastened the demise ofsome plants that were already pressured by refining capacity expansions in Asia and the Middle East.""There's light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Mark Williams, principal analyst for short term refining and oil productsmarkets at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. ""The upside is reliant on people not only driving, but starting to fly.""Across Europe, there are signs that road traffic is increasing. At the end of last month, U.K. fuel sales hit theirhighest since the country first went into lockdown, while toll road usage in France, Italy and Spain all recentlyreached their strongest in months versus 2019 levels. In another bullish signal, euro zone manufacturing expandedat its fastest pace in April since at least May 2018.That's all good news for diesel-type fuel, which in Europe is used in passenger cars, freight and some heating. Thecontinent's refiners make more than twice as much diesel as gasoline, according to the International EnergyAgency.The agency sees the continent's total oil demand rising by more than 9% this quarter and almost 4% in the next.Several European crude traders said demand for physical cargoes from the region has strengthened in the past fewweeks.Gasoline BetterEurope's plants would be doing even better if yields were more weighted toward gasoline - as they are in the U.S. -because profits from making the fuel are around $10 per barrel, partly thanks to the strong recovery in consumptionon the other side of the Atlantic, a key export market for Europe.Even with Europe's diesel focus, refining margins for Spain's Repsol SA and Poland's Grupa Lotos SA still rose inApril. So did those of Austria's OMV AG, which expects better profits in the second half of this year. OECD Europe'scrude processing volumes are also set to see a ""substantial increase"" next quarter, according to the InternationalEnergy Agency. Wood Mackenzie sees them closing in on 2019 levels.There are even signs of a tentative improvement in the jet fuel market. The continent's refiners originally slashedthe amount they produce from every barrel of crude in response to the pandemic. Those yields are now starting torecover. At Europe's plants, the yield of jet, and, kerosene - used to make aviation fuel, and for heating in someparts of the world - hit a ten-month high in February, and is likely to rise.""May, June, July, I would expect an improvement,"" said Hedi Grati, a director at IHS Markit. ""But I don't expect themto get anywhere near the 9%"" that was seen in January 2020, he added. The continent's flight numbers are still onlyabout 38% of pre-pandemic levels, according to data from Eurocontrol, though air travel is starting to open up.Despite the improving picture, Europe's refining industry still faces significant headwinds.Since the pandemic began, there have been announcements of plant closures in France, Belgium, Finland andPortugal and of capacity reductions in the Netherlands and U.K. More will almost certainly follow, with newrefineries coming online in Asia set to flood the continent with cheap fuel, potentially eroding profits for local plants.""Margins in Europe remain weak for the foreseeable future,"" Williams said. ""Weaker, more simple refiners, withlower complexity, which don't have petchem integration - they're on the chopping board.""More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comÂ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.Bloomberg.com( http://www.bloomberg.com ) !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

May 2021;"US jet fuel market faces regionally tight supply on pipeline outage; airline";"HOUSTON (ICIS)-- The US jet fuel market is facing regionally tight supply as the Colonial Pipeline shutdown hasentered its fifth day.The majority of Colonial Pipelines operations remain shut from the cyberattack last Friday.Jet fuel supply in the northeastern and southeastern US is tightening as shipments are unable to be delivered dueto the continued pipeline shutdown.American Airlines said it has added a fuel stop to two daily long-haul flights out of Charlotte, North Carolina,because of a jet fuel supply shortage in the area, according to the company.American Airlines is the first airline to announce an impact from the pipeline outage.Market sources said United Airlines said it is currently delivering fuel to four airports.The US government said it is currently examining whether or not it should waive the Jones Act shippingrequirements in order to encourage more supply shipments within the US.The Jones Act requires goods shipped within US ports to be transported on ships that are owned, built, andoperated by US citizens or permanent residents.[1]Colonial Pipeline continues to bring segments of its pipeline system back online in a stepwise fashion, thecompany said in its latest statement.Colonial said that while the situation is fluid and continues to evolve, the company is executing a plan that bringsback lines in an incremental process and a phased return to service.The US Energy Secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said on 11 May that the company is expected to make a full restartdecision by end of day 12 May, although once a restart decision is made it will take a few days before the pipeline isfully operational.Granholm added that once the pipeline is operational the government and Colonial will send fuel to the areas thatare facing the worst shortages.Colonial said its goal is to substantially restore service by the end of the week.[2]Line 4, which runs from Greensboro, North Carolina to Woodbine, Maryland, is operational on a limited basis. adjusts flight routesThe statement added that the line is running under manual control for a limited period of time while existinginventory is available, while the main lines continue to be offline.Colonial Pipeline s smaller lateral lines between terminals and delivery points [3]are operational.Focus article by Alex SnodgrassReferences1. https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00110637405 2.https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00110637449 3.https://subscriber.icis.com/news/petchem/news-article-00110637233"
May 2021;"Jet kerosene: Latest Europe developments";"LONDON (ICIS)--Despite thin trading, European jet fuel spot values remained firm this week.Closing prices edged up by 3-4% on a weekly average basis, with increased optimism following rising bookings andmore flying activity amid the easing of lockdown restrictions ahead of the summer holiday period.An aviation industry source indicated that they were operating at 50% capacity of 2019 levels compared to a low of25% of 2019 at the same time last year.This supported the prompt-month jet fuel crack spread against rolling Brent crude futures to hold steady at$3.50/bbl despite reduced business hours due to the early May public holiday.The jet fuel market remains in contango, with the crack spread for H2 2021 accelerating to $8/bbl, albeit still belowthe long-term average of $10/bbl and above, industry sources said.Amid reduced refinery output and limited inflows, the market has been fairly balanced.A jet fuel trader said jet barge trade had been quiet, while northwest Europe will receive only around 790,000tonnes for May arrival, leaving the market a couple of vessels short compared to the 1m tonnes previouslyanticipated.According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), European air travel demand measured in revenuepassenger kilometres (RPKs) fell 88.3% in March 2021 versus March 2019, slightly ahead of the 89.1% decline inFebruary compared with the same month in 2019.IATA forecasts that RPKs (a proxy for jet fuel demand) in Europe will be 66.3% below 2019 this year not evenrecovering to 50% in H2 2021 as the region remains heavily reliant on international markets. The high levels ofrestrictions on international travel are limiting any rebound.This is likely to keep jet fuel consumption rates low compared with pre-pandemic levels, although a gradualimprovement in demand from H2 May cannot be ruled out. Low refinery run rates and restrictive inflows couldprovide further upside."
May 2021;"European Snapshot: Lower Supplies Erode Regional Surplus";"European jet fuel markets started working off their chronic surplus in February amid a downturn in supplies. Jetfuel output dropped to 1.2 million tons after refiners cut throughput rates by nearly 10% from January to 38 milliontons. Imports plummeted by 22% to 1.5 million tons as cargoes were diverted from European ports across theAtlantic, where a severe winter storm disrupted US Gulf Coast refinery operations in mid-February.The drop in supplies matched a 64% plunge in jet demand from pre-pandemicrates. Lockdowns across Europe tocontain another wave of the virus cut air traffic by two-thirds, pushing jet demand down to 1.7 million tons. Jet fuelstocks stabilized at 11.6 million tons or 16% above the year-ago mark, with high tanks in Spain accounting for mostof the surplus.

May 2021;"Europe jet fuel momentum boost expected from summer tourism";"LONDON (ICIS)--European jet kerosene spot prices stayed fairly range-bound throughout most of the week amidlimited market action although monthly average prices continued to strengthen compared to 2020 levels, with thereopening of borders ahead of summer holidays expected to boost momentum.Amid cautious optimism around aviation growth, European jet fuel monthly averages have exhibited an upwardstrend since the start of the year, with the May 2021 average at $573/tonne on a CIF (cost, insurance & freight) NWE(northwest Europe) basis, up considerably from the May 2020 average of $216/tonne but about $100/tonne lowerfrom 2019 levels.This upswing has been more attributed to the rally in upstream Brent crude futures than airline demand growth aproxy for jet fuel consumption as European operations remain below 45% of 2019 levels.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) in Europewill be 66% below 2019 this year not even recovering to 50% in the second half of 2021.With the opening of the US-European transatlantic market ahead of the summer holidays, aviation demand isexpected to gain pace on this route as passengers will be allowed to travel with negative coronavirus test results forvacation.Further, COVID-19 tested travellers are now allowed to plan vacations across some European countries, includingIceland, Italy, Croatia and Greece, boosting flight bookings, while some European nations are also willing to admitBritish tourists who have been vaccinated.As European summer turnarounds are expected to reduce, refineries are likely to benefit from high-margin productssuch as gasoline, which is likely to prove detrimental for gasoil and jet fuel markets facing demand issues.In fact, during the pandemic, refineries have been operating at 70-80% of capacity with producers less incentivisedto increase throughputs as they were struggling to secure margins following limited demand, plunging prices andsoaring inventory levels.Adding to the market woes are inflows which although at reduced levels continue to arrive. Europe is expected toreceive around 650,000 tonnes for June, which could compound market supply if refinery run rates accelerate anddemand fails to match.NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK According to the International Energy Agency, kerosene demand has witnessed thebiggest fall of all refined products and was lower by 41% in 2020. However, the market is expected to rebound by18% in 2021, said the agency.Looking ahead, all eyes remain on the European Commission proposal to lift travel restrictions on non-EU countriesfor those who are vaccinated or can present a negative virus test, which is likely to be discussed later this week, topave the way for jet fuel demand.Focus article by Shruti Salwan"
May 2021;"Jet fuel demand recovery faces long haul as travel stays regional";"Limited long-distance flights and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in India will keep jet fuel demand below pre-pandemic levels over the coming months, even as the easing of lockdowns in other parts of the world boostsdemand for the aviation fuel.Steady vaccination rollouts and reduced infection rates in Western countries are allowing commercial travel toresume.It will, however, be dominated by short-haul flights, which account for almost two-thirds of the total fuel used by thesector, but on average use around 35 times less fuel than long-haul flights, the International Energy Agencyestimates.The result will be jet fuel demand of around 5.8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, almost 30% higher than2020, but below the 8 million bpd of 2019 before the pandemic struck, energy consultancy FGE says.Goldman Sachs expected jet fuel demand to rise to 3.9 million bpd in May, compared with the low of 2.2 millionbpd in May 2020.""You see the passenger numbers are recovering, but they are flying shorter distances, so the relationship betweenthe passenger number and the jet fuel demand is distorted,"" Cuneyt Kazokoglu, head of oil demand analysis atFGE, said.""For the full recovery, we need international travel to recover as well, and for that we have to reach a certain level ofvaccination, not just in a couple of countries.""HOPE-DRIVEN RISESHopes for more travel have driven airline and airport stocks higher.Among the gainers, Lufthansa has lowered its capacity forecast for flights this year, but predicted a gradual demandpick-up in April-June and a ""significant market recovery"" in the second half, citing moves by the European Union toopen up transatlantic travel to vaccinated U.S. visitors.Despite the buzz, there is a huge disparity in flight bookings as the rate of vaccine rollouts and infections vary, whilecountries with successful vaccine programs are reluctant to allow unlimited travel.Britain said on Friday it would allow international travel to resume from May 17, but would limit the number ofdestinations open for quarantine-free holidays to 12 countries.U.S. passengers booked about 800,000 more flight seats in the week ended Monday on-week, aviation dataanalysis firm OAG found, while India had 275,000 fewer seats and Japan was down by about 347,000.China stands out as its flight capacity this week exceeded pre-pandemic levels.

May 2021;"Shell Aviation and AmEx form alliance to increase supply of SAF";"Shell Aviation and American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) have announced they will collaborate on analliance for making sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available. The parties will design a model aimed at increasing the supply and use of SAF and accelerating the aviationindustry's pathway towards net-zero emissions (NZE). This collaboration combines the buying power of airlines and GBT's corporate business travel customers at scaleto drive a step change in production and usage of SAF. Lower or zero carbon technologies such as hydrogen and electric flight are unlikely to impact at scale until mid-century. This leaves SAF as the only viable, in-sector, option for reducing emissions in the short to medium term. Anna Mascolo, president of Shell Aviation, said: ""We want to help decarbonise the aviation sector and believe thiscollaboration could deliver new solutions for our customers to reach net-zero emissions. SAF has incrediblepotential to drive the decarbonisation of aviation. Even if all publicly announced projects today actually materialise,SAF would still account for just one percent of the jet fuel market by 2030."" GBT chief executive Paul Abbott said: ""Our approach with Shell could provide a turnkey solution for corporationsworking towards net-zero emissions. We believe aggregating corporate and airline demand is the most efficient wayto drive the volume of investment needed to bring change at scale. By working with Shell, we aim to enablecorporations and airlines to plot a course towards their own emissions targets, while acting as climate leaders andcreating real change."" This collaboration will help drive transformation of the aviation and corporate travel sector, support a net-zeroemissions future and deliver a new solution to customers in support of their own energy transition and carbonreduction ambitions. Both Shell and GBT have set their own individual targets to become net-zero emissions businesses by 2050, instep with society."

May 2021;"Europe Set for Late Summer Jet Demand Boom";"Europe’s jet fuel market is poised for a late-summer revival as quickening Covid-19 vaccination rates allowregional governments to finally start planning for the long-awaited restart of global air travel.Brussels has already approved the use of a Digital Green Certificate to allow EU passengers with proof of either aCovid-19 vaccination, a recent negative test or immunity after a recent infection to fly freely within the bloc fromJune.It also wants to open the door to international travelers that have been fully vaccinated, allowing for the restart ofmuch more fuel-hungry long-haul flights around the same time.Barely 11% of Europe’s revenue passenger miles are internal compared to around three-quarters in the giant USdomestic market.UK Color SystemThe UK has meanwhile shied away from the idea of vaccine passports, instead proposing a complicated traffic lightsystem based on risk.A list of countries and their risk level was released late Friday ahead of a planned May 17 restart of nonessential airtravel, leaving airlines and passengers little time to plan.Travel to low-risk ""green"" countries will require testing, while travelers to ""amber"" and ""red"" countries will also facereturn quarantines, either at home or in a government-approved hotel.The ""green"" list includes Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, theFalkland Islands, Israel and Portugal. Popular European holiday destinations are mostly ""amber,"" and Turkey isnow ""red.""British Airways (BA) CEO Sean O’Doyle slammed the UK color scheme, saying he'd prefer a single set of rules tobe applied globally to restart international aviation.BA expects a surge in demand for premium leisure and so-called VFR (visiting friends and relatives) trips to offsetwhat could be a slow start for business travel. But he was still optimistic about the prospects for business trips,suggesting people are fed up of Zoom.Low-cost UK airline Jet2 isn't even bothering to restart its flights until late June, arguing that the UK's onerous andexpensive testing and quarantine requirements will keep overseas travel out of reach for many passengers used tobudget flights and cheap getaways.Premium HitOutright jet fuel prices are already back to pre-Covid-19 levels in Europe but premiums against benchmark ICElow-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) are still barely half what they were before the pandemic.Northwest European cargoes were pegged at a $23.75 per metric ton premium to May LSGO at Thursday’s close,down from a $26.50/ton differential a week ago. LSGO has become a target for bullish traders placing bets onEurope's demand recovery. Speculative money in the contract has reached its highest in 15 months.European jet premiums tanked to almost $90/ton below ICE LSGO futures last April when European airspace wasclosed to all but cargo traffic, having been comfortably in the $40/ton over the screen during the first quarter of2020.Regional departures were still down 65% from pre-pandemic levels this week, according to air traffic controllerEurocontrol, having failed to reach even half of normal levels last summer ( IOD Mar.25'20 ).Eurocontrol Director-General Eammon Brennan said the stage was now set for a strong European recovery in thefourth quarter. Brennan suggested the EU was running six to eight weeks behind the US and UK in its vaccinationprogram -- meaning it would be July before regional flights could properly resume. He indicated it would be Octoberor November before travel to Asia could begin to restart.Optimism around airline fuel buying has yet to translate into spot market activity with no public trades seen so farthis month. Last year saw a spot trading boom as regular airline fuel suppliers were forced to sell unwantedcargoes while others sought to cash in on a stockpiling contango.Traders are already warning of ample stocks and the potential for a surge in East of Suez imports when airlinebuying does finally appear.Closely watched jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp fell 3.5% on the week to 946,000 tons on May 6 butremain almost 14% above year-ago levels.Previously lifeblood jet imports from the Mideast and Asia are running at around half of pre-pandemic levels, morethan making up for reduced European refinery production as regional producers continue to focus more on diesel.Kerry Preston, London"

Jun 2021;"Recent advances in the sustainable aviation industry";"The global aviation industry currently accounts for about 2.5% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions (1). A report claims that air traffic doubles every 15 years, with an 80% increase in the number of flights between theyears 1990 and 2014 (2). With that being said, global aviation emissions are projected to grow by 300-700% compared to the 2005 levels (3).This drives the urgency to implement more environmentally sustainable technologies into the aviation system.Increased interest in this effort is motivated by the impact of burning fossil fuels which includes natural resourcedepletion as well as climate change. In addition, the aviation sector is concerned by rising oil prices anddependence on suppliers (2). Thus, researchers all over the world are scrambling to figure out a more secure way to fuel aviation and mitigate itscarbon footprint. Over the years, the aviation industry has increased its productivity in several ways including traffic control andaircraft fuel efficiency. Accordingly, U.S. airlines have achieved an improved efficiency of 130% compared to 1978(4). However, despite the immense aircraft technology improvements, the industry has only been able to reduce carbonemissions by less than 15% (5). Although there are possible improvements to be made in turbofan engines for the purpose of decreasing emissions(6), it is clear to many experts that decoupling carbon growth will require the implementation of aviation fuel whichis not derived from petroleum. Jet engine design evolution generally takes 14-19 years to complete and is extremely expensive, costing hundredsof millions of dollars, in comparison to the process of fuel certification, which generally takes 3-5 years and costs$5-15 million. Furthermore, non-liquid fuel technologies like electrification or fuel cells do not currently have the sufficient energydensity to run a commercial aircraft (4, 5). Figure 1 displays a comparison of various potential energy sources foraviation. Therefore, a more feasible approach to this issue will be to implement drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) intothe current aircraft infrastructure. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), SAFs are defined as alternative aviation fuelswhich achieve net greenhouse gas emission reduction throughout the life cycle, respect biodiversity, contribute tosocial and economic development, and avoid competition with food and water supply. Research into alternative aviation fuels began following the increase in fuel price in the 1970s, which was causedby concern regarding security of supply (7), and the first flight fueled by blended biofuel took place in 2008 (8). With airlines committed to reducing their carbon footprint by 50% before 2050 (1, 4), there is a clear need to beginthe process of implementation. That is why United Airlines began using alternative fuels in 2016, and Delta Airlines currently plans for 10% of itsfuel to be SAF by the end of 2030 (9). According to studies, the use of SAFs as a replacement for conventional fuelhas the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55-92% compared to 2005 levels (10). Thus, this approach is more promising in the near term than any other, and it is already in the works of beingexecuted. In October 2016, the ICAO announced the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation(CORSIA), which aims at offsetting 80% of harmful emissions above 2020 levels. The plan involves a proposed timeline for implementation and transition. There will be three phases: Phase I willtake place during the years 2021-2023, Phase II will be during the years 2024-2027, and Phase III will be from2028-2035. Phases I and II are known as the voluntary phases, in which airlines may choose to participate, whereas Phase IIIwill involve obligatory mandates which will be enforced by requiring extra payment for producing excess carbonemissions above 2020 levels for all international flights (5).In order to meet the ICAO goals, over 30% of the global jet fuel consumption will need to be SAF by 2040 (4).Jet fuels consist of four families of hydrocarbons: n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics. Other molecular families such as oxygenated molecules, heteroatom-containing molecules, unsaturatedhydrocarbons (olefins), and metals are unsuitable. This may be due to varying reasons which include poor thermalstability, freeze point, and specific energy. The bulk properties of jet fuel are mainly determined by the hydrocarbonclass composition. Important performance properties include specific energy, energy density, emissions, andthermal stability. Safety and operability limits are primarily shaped by the viscosity, density, surface tension, flashpoint, and reactivity (DCN) of a fuel. Additionally, low freeze point is a key property among jet fuels, for it allows long-range flights to use more optimumflight profiles. These properties essentially determine the range, payload, and cycle efficiency of a jet fuel in use.Table 1 outlines each of these properties and their relevance. Improvements to the specific energy can enable more passengers and cargo by reducing the weight of the aircraftduring flight. Therefore, when formulating alternative jet fuels, there is an opportunity to not only substitute but out-perform traditional fuels by producing a hydrocarbon mixture of maximum desirability while maintaining drop-incompatibility (4). The n- and iso-alkane classes generally compose about 55-60% of conventional jet fuel. These molecules tend tohave high specific energy, low energy density, and high thermal stability in relation to others. However, despitehaving the highest DCN among similar hydrocarbons, n-alkanes are known to have poor jet fuel characteristics, forlarger versions have high freeze points while smaller versions do not meet the required flash point. Therefore, theblend potentials of n-alkanes are limited. In contrast, iso-alkanes have low freeze points and demonstrate desirablejet fuel properties, though they are expensive and require continued research and development toward reducingtheir cost. (4) The hydrocarbon family of cycloalkanes includes a diverse spectrum of molecules. Average Jet A fuel iscomposed of monocyclic and fused bicyclic molecules. Monocyclic alkanes can portray a density, specific energy,freeze point, and flash point which exceeds the necessary requirements. Different subclasses of cycloalkanemolecules have varying properties and remain an area of exploration within this field. (4)The aromatics present in conventional jet fuel are mostly alkyl aromatics with low amounts of multi-ring variations.Collectively, aromatics demonstrate low specific energy, high energy density, and poor emission reports. These molecules are necessary in jet fuel to ensure the swelling of seals in order to prevent fuel leaks (this onlyapplies to seals which have previously been exposed to fuel). However, aromatics have been labeled as the mostsignificant contributor toward soot and particulate matter emissions, being responsible for up to 90%. Owing to thefact that these molecules do not burn cleanly, environmental benefits have been realised with fuels containing alow aromatic content (4). SAFs with low aromatic content have been reported to reduce soot formation and other emissions by 50-70% (1).. Since drop-in SAFs are blended with petroleum fuel containing adequate amounts of aromatics for swelling, thereis little need for renewable fuels to continue to contain these molecules (4). Table 2 shows a breakdown of thebest-case, average, and worst-case composition makeup and properties in jet fuel. Putting things into perspective, out of the four hydrocarbon groups, the two most important for researchers to lookinto are iso-alkanes and cycloalkanes. Iso-alkanes are necessary for specific energy, while cycloalkanes providesufficient energy density. Aromatics show the least desirable characteristics and are therefore limited to 20% capacity. Research has shownopportunities to produce an attractive fuel in which aromatics are diluted with renewable iso-alkanes initially, to thenbe fully replaced by cycloalkanes. A SAF containing a mixture of cycloalkanes and iso-alkanes could increaseenergy density and specific energy, as well as meet the other performance characteristic requirements such asfreeze point, flash point, swelling demands, and low emissions (4). Figure 2 summarises a strategic outlook on thefour hydrocarbon families. SAFs refer to a wide range of alternative aviation fuel types which can be made using a variety of methods fromdifferent feedstocks and waste products. Common feedstocks include municipal solid waste, cellulosic waste, usedcooking oil, or plants such as camelina, jatropha, halophytes, or algae. There are also non-biological alternativefuels such as what is known as power-to-liquid jet fuel (11). Some alternative jet fuels are currently approved forflight by ASTM D7566 in blends with traditional kerosene of up to 50% (12).ASTM D7566 is the Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons. Any fuel intended to be put to commercial use must be certified by ASTM International first, undergoing a longprocess of testing. As of 2020, there have been eight pathways approved by ASTM for the production of SAFs.Seven annexes to D7566 are outlined in Table 3. In addition, ASTM D1655-20b (as of 2020) permits co-processing as a means of converting fats, oils, and greasesfrom petroleum refining into jet fuel for a blending limit of up to 5% (4). Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) is the earliest SAF to be approved by ASTM. This fuel is a mixture of iso- and n-alkanes and can also be called syngas. The production process involvesgasification with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which transforms either lignocellulosic biomass or solid waste intofuels (7). The main feedstocks are different types of biomass, including wood waste, grass, or municipal solid waste (4). Key steps include feedstock pretreatment, gasification, syngas conditioning, Fischer-Tropsch catalysis, distillation,and hydrocracking, with the possible addition of isomerization and catalytic reforming (7). This fuel can be applied to turbofan engines in blends with traditional petroleum fuel of up to 50% (4). FT-SPK canalso be produced through a power-to-liquid (PtL) process in which carbon and hydrogen are catalytically combinedvia electrolysis. Electricity, water, and a concentrated source of CO2 are required for this operation. Costs for thisroute can be very high depending on the electrical cost. However, PtL is currently attracting widespread interest due to its ability to produce fuels with low greenhouse gasemissions without the involvement of biomass feedstock constraints (7). Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK) is the most commercially mature route [7]. It has a similar molecular composition as FT-SPK, consisting of iso- and n-alkanes. It is produced by thehydrotreating of esters and fatty acids from fats, oils, or greases derived from feedstocks such as algae, jatropha,and camelina [4]. Hydrogen is utilized to convert unsaturated compounds like alkenes and aromatics into more stable molecules likecycloalkanes and paraffins. The energy conversion efficiency for this route is about 76%, which is the highest efficiency among approved biojetfuel technologies. In addition, the lowest alternative fuel costs are associated with this pathway in terms ofhydroprocessing used cooking oils or animal fats [7]. This fuel can be applied in blends of up to 50% [4]. Unlike the others, Hydroprocessed Fermented Sugars to Synthetic Isoparaffins (HFS-SIP) is made up of a singlemolecule, which is a 15-carbon hydrotreated sesquiterpene known as farnesane. Farnesane is produced by thefermentation of sugars, which is done commercially from sugar cane juice. However, this fuel is limited to blends of up to 10% [4]. The process involved in converting lignocellulosic sugarsinto fuels causes this to be the most expensive alternative fuel pathway due to its complexity and low efficiency [7]. FT-SPK with aromatics (FT-SPK / A) is essentially the same as the first approved SAF, with the addition ofaromatics in the molecular composition. The feedstocks are the same as well, that being renewable biomass suchas municipal solid waste, and agricultural and wood waste. This fuel can be blended up to 50% for directapplication. [4] Alcohol-to-jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK) is currently approved for SPK from iso-butanol for up to30% blends as well as from ethanol for up to 50% blends. This fuel consists of iso-alkanes of 8, 12, or 16 carbonswhen starting from iso-butanol. When starting from ethanol, the carbon number can be broadened and the branching level can be reduced.Feedstocks for the production of alcohol include agricultural waste like corn shoots, grass, and straw, or cellulosicbiomass [4]. The alcohols are then turned into jet fuel through the processes of dehydration, oligomerization,hydrogenation, isomerization, and distillation [7]. The highest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the ATJroute can be achieved by using iso-butanol derived from forest residues, yielding an outstanding reduction of 74%[2]. Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Synthesized Kerosene (CH-SK or CHJ) is produced from lipids derived from vegetableor animal fats. This fuel contains all four hydrocarbon families, including n-, iso-, and cyclo-alkanes, as well asaromatics. The lipids are converted into jet fuel using a supercritical hydrothermal process, to then be blended withpetroleum fuel in up to 50% composition. [4] Hydroprocessed Hydrocarbons, Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HHC-SPK or HC-HEFA-SPK) is made from lipids derived from a specific species of algae called Botryococcus braunia that have undergonehydrocracking/hydroisomerization in order to remove oxygen and saturate double bonds. The product of thisprocess is rich in iso-alkanes. This pathway was the first to be approved through the ASTM D7566 ""fast track""process, but it is limited to blends of up to 10%. [4] ASTM D1655-20b allows the coprocessing of mono-, di-, and triglycerides, as well as free fatty acids and fatty acidesters of up to 5% FT hydrocarbons. Hydrocracking/hydrotreating and fractionation are required for this process.Thus far, coprocessing in refineries is not permitted for jet fuel besides this one pathway. [4] Before reaching the D7566, fuels must make it past the ASTM D4054 approval process. Currently, several fuelsare caught in the D4054 approval pipeline, waiting to be streamed into D7566 approval. This includes SPK (n- andiso-alkanes), cycloalkanes, aromatics, and mixtures of all four hydrocarbon families. [4] Although society is set on the objective of implementing SAFs, the endeavor will not be that easy. A significantbottleneck within this field is the fact that the jet fuel market size is large and growing. The 106-billion-gallon global market is projected to reach over 230 billion gallons by 2050. With biomass as themain SAF feedstock, there is currently about 340 million tons of biomass available in the U.S. This could amount toroughly 21 billion gallons of jet fuel, which just about matches the domestic market size [4]. However, the aviationfuel industry has to compete with other feedstock-demanding markets such as ethanol and biodiesel [5]. Currentpolicies are focusing renewable fuels toward diesel and the much larger, more demanding motor-vehicle industry[4]. In 2014, there were about 1.2 billion vehicles on the road compared to only 26,000 commercial aircrafts in flight. This demonstrates the unbalanced market sizes and gives reason to why there may be a skew in the raw materialdemand. However, this also means that integrating alternative fuels into the aviation industry could potentially be alot easier due to its small size and centralized nature [13]. To prevent diesel and ethanol production from corneringthe biomass supply, appropriate policies should be placed so as not to skew the focus [4]. Another notable barrier in the widespread application of SAF is that alternative fuels are significantly moreexpensive in comparison to traditional Jet A fuel. To demonstrate, the cost of SAFs range from 2 to 5 times theprice of fossil kerosene [7]. Considering that fuel makes up 20-30% of aviation operating costs, this will be aproblem for the industry [4]. As it is, airlines are expected to pay 40% more for jet fuel by 2040 compared to whatthey paid in 2014 [5]. In order for SAF to scale, prices need to be reduced through research and development. Considering that the processes used to generate fossil kerosene and alternative fuels are very similar, the mainfactor driving the high cost of SAF is feedstock. One way to mitigate the price of feedstock is by gravitating towardless expensive materials such as wastes. Using feedstocks like used cooking oil or municipal solid wastes putssomething potentially harmful to the environment to good use at a lower price, thus ""solving another problem"" in theprocess [4]. Additionally, since this approach does not require land to produce the feedstock, there are lesssustainability concerns [12]. For instance, the land use in the production of biomass feedstock, as well as the hydrogen and other inputsnecessary during the conversion processes of biojet fuel generate carbon emissions which need to be considered[5]. However, these concerns can be diminished when taking into account the lifecycle basis in which excess carbonproduced is recycled through the biomass via photosynthesis. The amount of CO2 absorbed by plants is similar to the amount emitted during the combustion of biofuel. In thisway, remaining neutral in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is much easier in comparison to the use ofconventional jet fuel [2], for these biofuels can reduce lifecycle emissions by 20-95% [12]. Therefore, wastematerial and raw biomass are both attractive feedstocks, but cost is still a concern. Although research needs to focus on reducing the price of SAF, there is hope for its current economic viability.Since these fuels are admissible under CORSIA, the upscaling of this technology will be aided. In June 2021, theAlliance for Aviation Across America held a meeting with local government officials to discuss commitments andinvestments in emerging technologies. Some key points covered were that SAF is primed for use and there is a need for increased federal and localsupport in order to achieve the sustainability goals present within the aviation community [14]. With government and investors' aid, various projects will continue to scale up, and costs should naturally comedown. In addition, we will be encountering an increase of carbon taxes in the near future, which will impact the priceof fossil kerosene and lessen the price gap between that and SAF [12]. Therefore, the SAF industry will eventuallyovercome the restrictions associated with cost. Though the urgency is present now, there is a projected increase in air travel by a factor of 2.75 by 2050 [10], andaviation emissions are expected to more than triple by then [15]. This further emphasises the need to transition ourcurrent system to one of more sustainability as soon as possible. In order to prevent global warming from getting out of control, we must begin to implement sustainable alternativeenergy such as SAF at a large scale immediately. In order for SAF to be feasible, it must meet the requiredconditions of performance, operability, and drop-in compatibility, as many SAFs do today [4]. For now and the coming years, the drop-in SAF research field has an opportunity to focus on enhancing fuelproperties and lowering emissions by using clean materials to generate high-energy content fuels. Outlooks onimproving specific fuel consumption exist by manipulating the hydrocarbon composition of upcoming alternativefuel technologies. Although differences in engine design within the near future are not expected, existing turbofanengines can use fuel that is up to 15% more energy dense than traditional jet fuel [4]. Moreover, in the pastdecade, over 200,000 flights have been fueled by SAF [2]. Thus, the aviation industry has begun to incorporate thisimportant technology, and owing to upcoming policy and legislation, will continue to do so until implementation iscomplete. Society has its mind set on reversing the effects of global warming, and in terms of the aviation sector,SAF is where we begin.

Jun 2021;"GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS: EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA";"WASHINGTON, June 8 -- The World Bank issued the following news release:Europe and Central AsiaRECENT DEVELOPMENTSThe region continues to grapple with COVID-19. After declining in early 2021, cases accelerated as new variantsemerged and population mobility increased. Vaccination progress has been uneven across the region. Theresurgence of COVID-19 cases in early 2021 has weighed on the incipient economic recovery; manufacturing hasfaltered; and services activity remains subdued.Recent currency depreciations have put further upward pressure on prices. Nearly half of the central banks of theregion that have inflation targets contended with inflation levels that exceeded the upper limits in early 2021, andpolicy rates have been raised in several countries.Fiscal support packages enacted to address the economic shock associated with the pandemic are expected to bepartially unwound this year. Due to the large fiscal response and last year's contraction in output, median publicdebt is expected to be 54% of GDP by end-2022, nearly 15 percentage points higher than in 2019. However,targeted fiscal support is estimated to have averted a large spike in poverty and job losses.OUTLOOKThe regional economy is forecast to expand a stronger-than-expected 3.9% in 2021, partly due to improvement inthe euro area. However, the outlook remains challenging given the recent worsening of the pandemic, tightermacroeconomic policy, and elevated policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.The forecast is predicated on a faster pace of vaccination in the second half of the year in the region's largesteconomies. Growth is expected to stabilize at 3.9% in 2022. However, per capita GDP in 2022 is forecast to be5.3% below the level expected prior to the pandemic.Growth in Russia, the region's largest economy, is projected to reach 3.2% in 2021, supported by firming domesticdemand and elevated energy prices. Tighter-than-expected macroeconomic policy and an escalation of geopoliticaltensions in 2021 are weighing on the outlook. Growth is expected to remain steady at 3.2% in 2022. In Turkey, thesecond largest economy in the region, growth is projected to rise to 5% in 2021, as exports benefit from firmingexternal demand, before moderating to 4.5% in 2022.In Central Europe, growth is projected at 4.6% in both 2021 and 2022, supported by a recovery in trade.Exceptional policy accommodation is expected to continue through 2021, and sizeable EU fund packages formember states should help mitigate weakness in investment.Growth in the Western Balkans is forecast to rebound to 4.4% this year and moderate to 3.7% in 2022, assumingconsumer and business confidence revives as vaccination takes place and political instability eases. The SouthCaucasus is projected to return to growth in 2021, expanding 3.6% and strengthening to 4.2% in 2022, predicatedon dissipation of shocks related to the pandemic and to conflict.Eastern Europe is projected to expand 1.9% in 2021 and 2.8% in 2022, as the recovery is constrained bygeopolitical tensions, subdued domestic demand, and structural weakness. Growth in Central Asia is forecast torecover to 3.7% in 2021 and 4.3% in 2022, supported by a modest rise in commodity prices, relaxation ofproduction cuts among major oil producers, and increased foreign direct investment.RISKSRisks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Although the region has had some success in administering thevaccine in some countries - mainly in Central Europe, the Western Balkans, and Turkey - deployment elsewherehas lagged.The pandemic could also add a further drag to already slowing investment in human and physical capital. Financialstress is another risk to the outlook. Intensifying geopolitical tensions or further rises in policy uncertainty poseadditional downside risks in the region.

Jun 2021;"EU Energy Transition: Made in Europe";"In Germany, we Greens pressed the start button on the energy transition when we entered Government for the firsttime, and we have since laid a path to 100 percent renewable energy. To date, this successful model is spreadingrapidly around the world.It is no coincidence that we are one of the market leaders in wind and solar technologies, creating hundreds ofthousands of jobs. Germany, an industrialised country, now sources over 50 percent of its electricity fromrenewables - while other countries like Denmark and Portugal source even more.We now need the same courage to bring this transition to industry throughout Europe. Industry is the backbone ofEurope's economy. While it provides a bulwark against financial crises, in order to keep it, it has to change. Weneed to take bold steps now. We Greens want to restart the transition again and begin the race for climate neutralityby 2040. Climate protection and the economy have not always gone hand-in-hand; however, they belong togetherand complement each other. We simply have to find the right fit and start running.""The race for the economy of the future has already started; China and the US are not waiting for us, rather theyare investing and regulating their markets""The European Union has all the tools to do this and has access to the funds to match. And the reform of theemissions trading system will be our biggest climate leverage. With this, we can achieve the phase-out of coal inthe EU by 2030, put in place the measures to decarbonise industry and trigger a boom in renewable energiesthroughout Europe. The fact that this creates jobs was recently demonstrated by the new solar factory in Saxony,which is creating thousands of secure jobs and supplying us with solar modules that are 'Made in Europe'.Emissions trading must now therefore become a core instrument for our industry; however, to date, too little hasbeen done. CO2-free steel or green hydrogen must be made fit for the market. We can do this with the rightarchitecture, which incentivises decarbonisation and penalises CO2 emissions.Industry has not yet decarbonised because of the free allocation of CO2 emission permits, meaning there is noincentive to change. But we can protect industry by introducing a Carbon Border Protection Mechanism and at thesame time incentivise the shift by removing the free allowances.Further supportive measures, such as quotas for CO2-free products and carbon contracts for difference mustsupport the rapid transition and give companies confidence that their investment in the decarbonisation of hugeplants will be pay off.We must not be afraid of change; a CO2 price of (EURO)150 in the year 2030 seems likely and positive. It leads theway to phase out coal and gives industry the framework to steer investment. However, without a proper framework,Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's European Green Deal will remain an empty shell.With a CO2 price and the above-mentioned tools, we can renew the steel mills, offer climate technologies for otherindustries and make them marketable for the future. Sustainability must be part of every business model in thefuture.""Germany, an industrialised country, now sources over 50 percent of its electricity from renewables - while othercountries like Denmark and Portugal source even more""But we must not kid ourselves. The race for the economy of the future has already started; China and the US arenot waiting for us, rather they are investing and regulating their markets. At the same time, the EU is the largestdomestic market in the world.We must use this as leverage and exploit possibilities within the frameworks of our trade agreements. A CO2-limitcompensation mechanism protects our industry from products with high emission levels and would initiate a globalrace for climate technologies. It would be a win-win situation for both our economy and the planet.In summary, the green transformation is a guarantee of prosperity for our economy and society. The job of thefuture has climate at its centre; however to achieve this, all investments must become climate investments.The European Union can deliver all of this. We are committed to restarting the energy transition that began morethan 20 years ago in the energy sector and establishing 'Made in Europe' as a green industry location. If we want tokeep what we have, we have to change."

""The prevailing market expectation is that oil consumption will outpace supply by summer, but the demandeuphoria is still receiving daily doses of reality as Covid-19 cases are boundlessly spreading in India and other partsof Asia.The bump in oil has given a fillip to energy firms, though broader US stock markets have struggled to advancemuch.Major US indices eked out gains, with energy equities the biggest winner, while health, industrial and materialssectors all pulled back.Investors have been torn between optimism over the recovering economy and worries over higher inflation.""We're in a bit of a holding pattern, where the major indices remain just below all-time highs but the momentumhasn't been there for a test of those levels,"" TD Ameritrade market strategist JJ Kinahan said in a trading note.""It's understandable, really, when you consider the possible ramifications of the data coming up not just this weekwith jobs but next week with May consumer prices,"" he added.In Europe, London, Paris and Frankfurt indices all rose, with the CAC 40 in Paris hitting its highest closing level thisyear.Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta all rose, with Manila surging more than three percent on reports thegovernment plans to ease some containment measures.However, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, Mumbai, Bangkok and Wellington dipped.

Jul 2021;"U.S. jet fuel glut is too big for surging air travel to drain";"By Bloomberg The U.S. is swimming in so much jet fuel that even this summer's surge in air travel can't save themarket. Air traffic in the U.S. has jumped to more than 2 million passengers a day, about 78% of where it was in thesummer of 2019, according to the Transportation Security Administration. That's done little to diminish the massiveglut in jet fuel stockpiles, which stand at their highest seasonal level in a decade.Part of the problem is that refiners are trying to cash in on resurgent gasoline demand by raising production rates,which indirectly leads to more jet fuel output. The global oil market can't fully recover to pre-pandemic levels untiljet fuel consumption is back to normal. The U.S. has one barrel of jet fuel for every three barrels of diesel andevery five barrels of gasoline in inventory, Energy Information Administration figures show, leaving the aviationsector exerting considerable influence on how much refiners can process. ""Traffic data is a false flag for the jet fuelmarket,"" said Zachary Rogers, director of global oil service at Rapidan Energy Group. ""The real metric is thequantity of international flights, which at this point has barely recovered, and there are looming headwinds."" Thebest indicator of the market mismatch is the widening gap between jet fuel and diesel. Typically the two productstrade within a nickel of each other but currently physical jet fuel is 18 cents a gallon less in the U.S. Gulf Coastrefining hub. Most analysts say a 10-cent spread would point to the beginning of a recovery in jet fuel markets.""Meeting gasoline demand meant swamping the market with jet fuel, which bled into the diesel pool, as refinerscan only minimize middle distillate supplies to a certain extent,"" said Linda Giesecke, manager of global fuels atESAI Energy. Most forecasts for the recovery in aviation place the return to pre-2020 conditions at next year orlater. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts wrote in a recent note that world jet fuel consumption will be at 80% ofnormal after next winter. Some airlines are still advising caution over the travel comeback, with Southwest AirlinesCo. and American Airlines Group Inc. reining in optimism this week. The return of vital international business tripsremains cloudy, with flights still restricted from much of Europe and the U.K. as the delta variant gains ground. Thebig gains in jet fuel demand already have been made, said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC PrivateWealth, US. The market will continue to move toward firmer footing, but the rate of change may slow, she said. ""Ifeel like the market really is anticipating still significant improvements, and I think they might be a little smaller thanthat,"" she said."
Jul 2021;"Global economic recovery will diverge in 2022: IMF";"The global economic recovery will be divergent in 2022, projected the International Monetary Fund(IMF).The baseline forecast is based on the following key assumptions:Vaccines, therapies and the pandemicThe IMF expects local transmission of the virus to be reduced to low levels everywhere by the end of 2022 througha combination of better targeted precautions and better access to vaccines and therapies.Overall, advanced economies are on track to achieve wide availability of vaccines by the summer of 2021.The IMF, too, assumes that some emerging markets will reach that point by the end of this year.In addition, it is expected that most countries will gain broad access by the end of 2022.Some countries will reach low levels of local transmission before others, depending on the specific circumstances ofthe country.However, the baseline assumes the possibility of additional waves before vaccines are widely available.fiscal policyThe forecast assumes additional fiscal support in the United States in line with the overall cumulative size of theU.S. Employment Plan and the American Family Plan proposed by the current administration.The baseline also incorporates the eu's expected grants and loans for the next generation into the forecasts forthese economies.The IMF expects fiscal deficits in most emerging markets to decline in 2021.Global economic recovery and monetary policyMajor central banks are supposed to leave policy rates unchanged for the entire forecast horizon (end of 2022).Some emerging market central banks have begun to reduce support and others are expected to follow suit later in2021.Rising commodity pricesCommodity prices are expected to rise at a significantly faster rate than assumed in the April 2021 WEO report.Amid the strengthening global recovery, oil prices are expected to rise about 60% above their low base in 2020.To conclude, the IMF projects that prices of non-oil commodities will rise about 30% above 2020 levels, reflectingparticularly sharp increases in the price of metals and food."
Jul 2021;"OUTLOOK: US jet fuel demand continues slow recovery through H2";"HOUSTON (ICIS)--The US jet fuel market is expected to continue its slow demand recovery through the secondhalf of 2021, although the market is not expected to be back to normal demand levels for several years.A full jet fuel market recovery is not expected until 2023, according to Barin Wise, vice president, CDI (now part ofICIS).""COVID-19 has changed business travel forever with the success of Teams, Zoom, etc. I think it will take leisuretravel to pick up the baton, and that will take some time. Export demand could help, but all global refiners aredealing with sharp reductions in international air travel,"" Wise said.Although demand has sharply recovered from the lows seen in 2020, it remains well below the levels seen in 2019,and the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus is expected to place additional downwards pressure assome US states reinstitute restrictions.International flight demand will also take several years for a full recovery as countries remain hesitant to reopentheir borders or lessen travel restrictions.While jet fuel prices have mostly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, the lack of international travel demand remainsone of the greatest hurdles in the market.ICIS Editorial Chart goes hereRefiners are expected to continue to moderate their rates through the remainder of 2021 in order to avoid anysignificant inventory buildup of jet fuel, despite rising distillate demand.Regardless of ample US supply of jet fuel, inventories of the product on the West Coast remain tight due to alreadylow inventories and strong demand from wildfire season.Planes for fighting wildfires are being increasingly used, heightening jet fuel demand in the region and constrictingsupply.Logistics constraints are also pressuring the market as the trucker shortage continues and many producers andbuyers are finding it increasingly difficult to hire truckers to haul jet fuel to its final destination.Focus article by Alex Snodgrass"
Jul 2021;"Jet fuel mirrors volatile oil prices as European aviation rebounds";"LONDON (ICIS)--European jet kerosene spot prices softened this week tracking fluctuations in the upstream crudeoil futures.Sparse trading in the physical jet fuel market also exerted downwards pressure.Sentiment, was however, buoyed by a recovery in European airline capacity. The region's capacity recovered toaround 50% of 2019 levels later in June, according to the latest data from Eurocontrol. The latest data coincideswith increased vaccination rates across Europe, reopening of borders and easing travel restrictions.Outright values, on a weekly average basis, remained fairly static from the week prior.However, market on close values for jet barges on a free on board (FOB) Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA)basis, dropped $2/tonne to $606.50/tonne, while jet cargoes CIF (cost, insurance & freight) NWE (northwestEurope) lowered to $619.25/tonne on Tuesday 06 July.Softening oil prices which dipped to $74/bbl earlier in the week, was offset by optimism around the summer holidayperiod which has lifted flight operating rates.Easing of travel restrictions across many European borders, including Germany, Spain and France - and the UK, by19 July, - has bolstered market confidence. Although some nations have been cautious about the more-contagiousDelta variant.That said, European aviation demand has been on a steady upward trajectory The Centre for Aviation (CAPA)suggests that so far in 2021, Europe has progressed from 27% of 2019 capacity in Q1 2021, to 34% in Q2 2021.The positive tone has, however, not filtered into jet fuel physical spot buying, with trading volumes stayingnegligible in the open market.This has been particularly evident from the unchanged jet differentials to the ICE gasoil futures, hovering around$20/tonne mark since mid-April.That said, prompt-month crack spread to rolling Brent has strengthened to $4.50/bbl this week, against $3.80/bblrecorded last week, backing improved market sentiments.CLOSED GLOBAL BORDERS HINDER RECOVERYThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that international and domestic travel demandshowed marginal improvements in May 2021, compared to the prior month. But traffic remained well below pre-pandemic levels.The association suggests recovery in international traffic,in particular, continued to be stymied by extensivegovernment travel restrictions.The latest IATA report states that total demand for air travel in May 2021 (measured in revenue passengerkilometers or RPKs) was down 62.7% compared to May 2019. But this figure was an improvement over the 65.2%decline recorded in April 2021 versus April 2019.A similar improvement was recorded by European carriers with May international traffic down 84.7% versus May2019. But this is an improvement from the 87.7% decrease in April compared to the same month in 2019.According to Eurocontrol, bookings are improving but demand for corporate and long-haul international air travelare lagging, thus restricting rebound.Opening of international borders not only remains crucial for European aviation sector but also for regional jet fuelconsumption rates. With progress towards relaxing international travel restrictions still patchy, growth is likely to becapped.CAPA suggests that the average of 72% of 2019 capacity currently scheduled for Q3 2021 looks optimistic as moreairlines are likely to enhance capacities by mid-July and August. However, any substantial impact on demand pullfor jet kerosene is yet to materialise."
Jul 2021;"Aviation fuel prices advance as European skies get busier";"LONDON (ICIS)--European jet kerosene spot prices retained weekly gains, as more aircraft take to the skiesacross the region, discounting any significant impact of fluctuations in the upstream crude oil values.Despite sparse trading and crude fluctuations, European jet kerosene spot continues to get support from the peaksummer aviation rebound.Intra-European flights, in particular, have seen a jump in bookings, with air traffic to increase by 70% from levelsseen in Q3 2019.Easing of travel restrictions and the peak summer holiday season has seen a continued increase in flight operationssince the start of July, with domestic flows still dominating in terms of traffic volumes, according to the Eurocontrol.Noticeable increases have been recorded on flows between Spain and the UK, as well as Greece and the UK, withtraffic rebounding to nearly 65% of 2019 levels.The continued rising trend has aided in boosting jet fuel consumption rates. Some market players expect demandto lift substantially in the next two months, reaching 60% of 2019 overall in the third quarter.Nonetheless, outright values continue to reflect fluctuations in the Brent crude futures, which recovered to the$74/bbl mark after falling sharply earlier last week to lows of $68/bbl.Jet kerosene CIF (cost, insurance & freight) NWE (northwest Europe) were assessed at $629.50/tonne on Tuesday27 July, while barges on FOB (free on board) ARA (Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp) closed the day at $627/tonne.The prompt-month crack spread against rolling Brent has lowered to $5.0/bbl - compared to $5.5/bbl last week - asstrength in upstream crude oil values pulled the crack down.While some demand pull from the Mediterranean continued, slowing demand in other major regional markets ofAsia and the US are likely to impact these trade dynamics.Stock levels in the US market are nearing historical highs and restrictions are returning. At the same time, air travelin Asia has slightly softened amid a resurgence in cases while a low vaccination rate in some countries in the regionis dampening demand.That could potentially mean that volumes are expected to stay or be rerouted to Europe, as adequate barrels havebeen seen coming from east of Suez for the month of July and August.Lower refinery run rates have been offset by increased inflows, while refinery operators still yield some volumes ofaviation fuel.This could exert downward pressure should the demand-side scenario continue to match, which is yet to see asignificant rebound.Return of restrictions in some of the US states - due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus - isexpected to place additional downward pressure.Even though demand has sharply recovered from the lows seen in 2020, it is yet to reach the highs seen in 2019."

Jul 2021;"Get ready for prolonged fuel price increases, warns economics academic";"Meshel Muzuva, a finance and economics lecturer at Mancosa, says that South Africanmotorists will have to contend with sky-high petrol and diesel prices for some time. The looming increase in fuelprices from 7 July is due to the international price of oil, which has skyrocketed over the past month, resulting inhigher costs for petroleum products.-Oil prices are trading at approximately $75 (R1,066) a barrel and are close to their highest level since 2018. Theincrease in petrol and diesel prices is a direct consequence of the sharp increase in global world crude oil prices,which in turn is a result of the key global economies like the USA, Europe and China swinging back into workmode after the impact of the pandemic. Even some marginal gains on the Rand were unable to control the impactof higher oil prices, says Muzuva. With these global trends, oil prices are not expected to fall anytime soon. So South African motorists will have todeal with high prices unless the government decides to reduce the taxes on fuel which account for 36% of fuelcosts.<!--EMBED:https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/390/217387.html :EMBED--> Consumers are being placed under increasing pressure to keep up, especially the poor and vulnerable who useparaffin for cooking, lighting and heating. With the country being in lockdown the fluctuating fuel costs will see many South Africans burning even largerholes in their pockets, with many spending considerable amounts of their income on fuel costs restricting theirspending potential in other, sometimes necessary, areas, says Muzuva. -"
Jul 2021;"Oil prices rising in two-speed market";"Oil prices have risen above $US75 ($100.45) a barrel as OPEC and a Russia-led group of producers met to weighsurging demand from the industrialised world - and delayed a decision about what to do.Thursday's OPEC meeting came at a time when some of the historical dynamics of the oil markets have beenthrown upside down by the pandemic. Demand growth from the developed world, which for years has stagnated, ison a tear as it emerges furiously from Covid-19 lockdowns. Meanwhile, the developing world - the source of almostall new demand in years past - is sputtering.A week ago, OPEC and allied producers led by Russia were leaning toward boosting production by half a millionbarrels a day, with more additions possible later in the year.Going into formal deliberations being held virtually on Thursday, Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, and Russiahad agreed to take up a proposal that includes a boost of about half a million barrels a day starting in August,according to people familiar with the talks, and then gradually increasing so-called OPEC+ output by a total twomillion barrels through December.But in a surprise move, OPEC said the group would postpone a decision until Friday. The United Arab Emiratesobjected to the proposed increase amid concerns about the robustness of the recovery, delegates said.Another wrinkle: a deal may be conditional on the status of Iran sanction talks with the world powers. Tehran isnegotiating a resumption of an Obama-era deal in which it would curb its nuclear ambitions in exchange for a liftingof sanctions on oil sales.US crude rose 2.4 per cent, closing above $US75 a barrel for the first time since 2018. Brent crude, theinternational benchmark, was up almost 2 per cent, closing at $US75.84 a barrel. In a sign that US demand isplaying a key role in prices, US crude has reduced a longstanding gap between the two benchmarks.Accelerating vaccination drives in the US and Europe are boosting global economic activity - and by extension,demand for oil. OPEC data showed markets needed two million barrels a day of extra oil this year. Meanwhile, theDelta variant of the coronavirus has wreaked havoc in India, an anchor of oil-demand growth in normal times.China, too, is seeing signs of economic softening as consumers pull back amid isolated outbreaks there. Thecountry is also struggling with supply bottlenecks that hamper production.OPEC has signalled it expects the surge in demand from industrialised countries to be temporary, so far standingby a forecast last year that rich-country demand won't ever hit pre-pandemic levels again. It cited an acceleratedembrace of alternative energy, decades of fuel-efficiency initiatives and slow or stagnant population growth.For now, though, the thirst for oil from richer countries has become the key, short-term demand driver. OPECexpects oil demand in industrialised nations to increase by 2.7 million barrels a day in 2021, up 6.3 per cent. Morethan half of that growth will come from the US, at 1.5 million barrels a day, it said. The trend will accelerate in thesecond half, with a boost of 3.1 million barrels a day.IHS Markit expects global demand in the third quarter to jump by about 7 million barrels a day from the first quarterof the year, driven by North America and Europe, at a clip of 10 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. That shouldget 2021 oil demand to some 99.1 million barrels a day in the third quarter, the consulting firm forecasts, still downfrom the 102 million barrels it estimates the world consumed in late 2019. It expects the world to hit that thresholdby the middle of next year.While the fast-changing demand picture presents a forecasting challenge, the size of the collective cutbacksOPEC+ enacted early last year leaves it with more ammunition than usual to calibrate supplies. It cut 9.7 millionbarrels of production as the scale of the pandemic became clear, and has since restored more than 4 million of that.That still gives it as much as 5 million barrels a day, or about 5 per cent of pre-pandemic demand, to give backeventually.""OPEC+ has a degree of market power that it has rarely had for many decades, at least temporarily,"" said JimBurkhard, head of crude oil market and energy and mobility research at IHS Markit.For now, the oil world is in a two-speed recovery. In the first three weeks of June, crude shipments arriving at Indianports came in at about 3.9 million barrels a day, down about 280,000 from the prior month, according to marketintelligence firm Kpler, which tracks vessels globally. In the US, by contrast, demand is back for road trips anddomestic air travel. Petrol demand could rise some 600,000 barrels a day over the next two months."
Jul 2021;"IMF forecasts 6% global economic growth";"WASHINGTON - The International Monetary Fund sharply upgraded its economic outlook this year for the world'swealthy countries, especially the United States, as COVID-19 vaccinations help sustain solid rebounds from thepandemic recession. But the 190-country lending agency has downgraded its forecast for poorer countries, most ofwhich are struggling to vaccinate.Overall, the IMF said Tuesday that it expects the global economy to expand 6% this year - a dramatic bounce-back from the 3.2% contraction in the pandemic year of 2020. The IMF's forecast, unchanged from its previousestimate in April, would mark the fastest calendar-year global growth in records dating to 1980.Beneath the worldwide number, however, a gap between the vaccine haves and have-nots is widening. The IMFexpects advanced economies to grow 5.6% this year, an upgrade from the 5.1% it forecast in April, fueled by theswift recovery of consumers and businesses. But it downgraded its 2021 forecast for emerging market anddeveloping countries to 6.3% from its April forecast of 6.7%.Gita Gopinath, the IMF's chief economist, told reporters Tuesday that more needs to be done to supply vaccines topoorer nations that lag far behind wealthier nations.""The recovery is not assured until the pandemic is beaten back globally,"" Gopinath said. She asked that wealthynations quickly fulfill their pledges to supply 1 billion does of the vaccine to developing nations.""Concerted, well-directed policy actions … can make the difference between a future where all economiesexperience durable recoveries or one where divergence is intensified, the poor get poorer and social unrest andgeo-political tensions grow,"" she said.Advanced economies, in which close to 40% of the population has been vaccinated, are largely reopening afterlast year's COVID-19 lockdowns. But in developing and emerging market countries, the vaccination rate is just11%. Moreover, the governments of poorer countries cannot match the outpouring of government spending that richcountries have been using to propel their economic recoveries.The United States is expected to register 7% growth this year, a sharp reversal from last year's 3.5% drop and anupgrade from the 6.4% growth the IMF had forecast for 2021 back in April.President Joe Biden's ambitious spending plans are expected to fuel growth this year and next. The IMF predictsthat the U.S. economy will grow 4.9% in 2022, up from the 3.5% it projected three months ago.The 19 European countries that share the euro currency are forecast to grow 4.6% collectively this year, versus lastyear's 6.5% contraction. Japan, which endured a 4.7% drop in economic growth in 2020, is expected to expand2.8% this year. But the 2021 forecast for Japan marks a downgrade from what the IMF expected in April, reflectinga resurgence of COVID-19 cases earlier this year.In the developing world, the outlook for China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, wasmarked down to 8.1% after the government scaled back spending and investment. The IMF also slashed its growthforecast for India to 9.5% from 12.5% three months ago after the country was overwhelmed by COVID cases."
Aug 2021;"Heightened global coronavirus restrictions to dampen US jet fuel demand";" HOUSTON (ICIS)--US jet fuel markets could take longer to recover than initiallyexpected due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus as well asreinstated restrictions across the country. The heightened restrictions due to the Delta variant and elevated jet fuel inventories aredenting previous expectations for a strong market recovery in 2021. International demand continues to be the final piece that is expected to push demandrecovery back to normal levels, but this is not expected until international restrictions areloosened. Many countries are keeping international travel restrictions in place until a betterunderstanding of vaccines and the spread of variants is achieved as well as an increase inglobal vaccination rates. The 2021 holiday season is also expected to encourage strong demand and inventorydraws, although the uncertainty around the spread of the Delta variant at that time iskeeping expectations tamped down some. made a sharp rebound on Monday and Tuesday, with a cutting 421,000bbl/day in domestic production. This resurgence happened despite global demand signals stillremaining muted, driven mainly by a weakening US dollar. The rise in crude futures pulled up jet fuel differentials this week, despite rising casesof the Delta variant pressuring demand and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)showing rising inventories. US refinery utilisation has largely recovered from the drop in February due to the freeze inTexas, keeping jet fuel inventories elevated, although it remains below normal levels forthis time of year due to ongoing pandemic related effects on fuels demand. Elevated refinery utilisation levels is keeping supply of jet fuel ample although refiners areattempting to blend jet fuel into diesel when possible in an attempt to offset the impacts ofweak demand. further Strong demand for petroleum products produced along with jet fuel, particularly gasolineand diesel, has encouraged refineries to process more crude oil to produce those high-demand products.

Aug 2021;"The global gig economy and its impact on business";"Over the past decade, the size of the global gig economy has risen exponentially. In 2018, this market was valuedat $204 billion in annual gross value and is expected to be reach $347 billion by the end of 2021. — File photoA generation ago, having a permanent job, which gave a good salary, along with perks and benefits like insurance,medical benefits, etc. was considered a norm. As the generation moved forward, maintaining a good standard ofliving became more difficult. People started to seek a greater work-life balance as their jobs turned more demandingand working hours more intense. This, coupled with the skyrocketing unemployment rates post the Great Recessionof 2008 gave a massive push to the 'global gig economy'.The need for supplemental income among the new generation and cost-cutting drives by organisations havepushed several professionals to take up short-term jobs, leading to a gradual shift in choice of employment.Additionally, the rapid technological growth aided the large scale acceptance of gig work as a way of living formany.By common definition, a gig economy is a free market in which organisations/businesses hire independent workersfor a short-term commitments.In recent years, the gig economy has been trending due to a significant rise in workforce that is looking for jobs thatallow them higher freedom in terms of selecting the kind of work they wish to do, and when they do it. In terms oftypes of gig workers, freelancers, independent contractors, project-based workers and temporary or part-time hiresmake up for the major categories.The global gig economyOver the past decade, the size of the global gig economy has risen exponentially. In 2018, this market was valuedat $204 billion in annual gross value and is expected to be reach $347 billion by the end of 2021. Of this, two-thirdsis disbursed to the millions of freelancers involved in the gig Economy, while the remaining is either collected ascommission by the digital platforms or distributed to third parties in the ecosystem (e.g. restaurant partners in fooddelivery services). Developed nations such as the US leads in gross volume contribution, accounting for 44 per centof the current global gig economy, as the country serves as the place of origin for many leading globalcompanies. Yet developing markets display a greater supply potential of freelancers within their existingdemography of lower-skilled labor and expansive populations.As per Payoneer's Global Gig Index 2019, the US topped the world in terms of growth in freelance earnings with 78per cent, followed by the U.K (59 per cent), Brazil (48 per cent), Pakistan (47 per cent), Ukraine (36 per cent), thePhilippines (35 per cent), India (29 per cent), Bangladesh (27 per cent), Russia (20 per cent), and Serbia (19 percent).Gig economy is changing the way we do businessThe rise in the gig economy has reduced fixed cost and the ability to adapt to market changes faster, while alsotapping into fresh talent, and altering the way several industries conduct their business. Technology-enabledplatforms made direct transactions between the parties involved easier. App-based technology platforms replacedmiddlemen to connect provider/producer and consumer with ease, enabling individuals to perform a variety of tasksbased on real time demand without any geographical limitations. During the pre-pandemic period there were about170 gig economy business in the US that only employed freelancers. Some of the major companies based on thismodel include AirBnb, Amazon Flex, Cabify, Etsy, Fiverr, Appen, Care.com, and Talkspace.For organisations with a global pool of clients, hiring gig workers based in different time zones has helpedorganizations offer better service, create global reach and improve its brand awareness in newer geographies theywish to expand into. Such a change in employment model has also helped the organisations significantly cut downcosts. Switching to payment on a project-to-project basis model has cut down the overhead costs to a large extent(e.g. reducing the need for insurance, severance pays and other benefits that permanent employees are entitledto).Impact of Covid-19 pandemicThe Covid-19 pandemic, which caused widespread disruption to businesses globally, came as a blessing indisguise for the gig economy. The pandemic accelerated the transition to digitization and the adoption oftechnology on a mass scale, much faster than previously forecasted. This acceleration, led by global industries,made it easier to shift to a remote working model on a scale that was never seen before. The e-commerce industrythrived in this process, with gig workers which make up for a significant portion of the delivery workforce, witnessinga considerable boost in demand. Additionally, the loss in business due to the pandemic which caused severalcompanies to scale down and cut jobs, resorted to temporary workers based on needs. Consequently, freelance,flexible and part-time jobs to gig workers across the globe grew in demand and lent a greater momentum to theglobal gig economy.The road ahead…The global gig economy, which is forecasted to be reach $455 billion by 2023, has been touted as the 'economicbackbone of the future'. The number of freelancers in the US, the largest market for gig workers, is expected togrow from 57 million currently to 86 million by 2027.Moreover, growth in the coming years is expected to largely stem from developing markets as large platforms enternew countries and regional platforms pursue expansion. Nevertheless, the gig economy is likely to encounterchallenges in the form of strategic planning and operations.Leading platforms, especially among the larger sectors, are likely to face challenges to acquire potential freelancersas gig services become more widespread and thus commercialised. As a result, gig companies would need toinnovate constantly to differentiate their solutions from competitors while also streamline their expansion strategies.In order to effectively navigate the road ahead, gig platforms are likely to establish strategic collaborations withexternal partners providing adjacent technologies that would help leverage their expertise to venture newer marketsand step-up hiring freelancer population required to support their growth objectives.The writer is a Dubai-based financier and an entrepreneur.

Aug 2021;"Jet kerosene edges lower in line with crude";"The price of jet fuel has continued to edge lower over the past month, as weaker crude oil prices have filteredthrough to the kerosene market.Energy information provider ICIS, which like Cirium is RELX-owned, assessed the price of jet fuel for delivery tonorthwest Europe at $594.75-596.00/tonne on 17 August, down $7.75/t on the previous week and significantlybelow a yearly high of nearly $650/t in mid-July.Source: Evgeny Haritonov/Shutterstock.com“The market has been indicated structurally weak, further exacerbated by flattening intra-European traffic flows”,comments ICIS. “Some refinery outages and lowering inventory levels are likely to lend some support, althoughfading demand-side fundamentals could limit upside.”It continues that rising Covid-19 cases in the US and Asia, as well as limited recovery in long-haul travel, isweighing on sentiment and demand. Jet fuel markets remain “swamped with offers seeing only a handful of bids”,suggesting extremely weak buying interest.Similar market dynamics were seen in North America, where jet fuel for delivery to New York harbour declined by$2.50 per US gallon to $184.50-184.75/gal, having briefly risen above $200/gal during July.“US spot jet fuel prices fell this week as restrictions are reinstated across the US amid rising cases of the Deltavariant, suppressing travel demand”, comments ICIS. “Crude oil prices plunged week-on-week due to the rapidspread of the Delta variant and expectations surrounding future refined product demand.”It adds that a continuing outstripping of supply to the market was likely to exert further downward pressure onprices, with inventory levels remaining at long-term highs.The possible closure of some refineries due to the Atlantic hurricane season could act to support prices, althoughthe two currently named storms in the region are expected to have only a minor impact.In Asia, similar price declines were seen. The per barrel cost of jet kerosene for delivery to Singapore declined by$0.86/bbl to $72.45-72.85/bbl on 17 August, having briefly touched $80/bbl in early-July.As elsewhere, ICIS largely attributed these declines to increased delta variant coronavirus infection rates in Asia,which have weighed on demand for middle distillates and gasoline, as nations introduce measures to curb mobility.It notes that refinery measures to curb jet kerosene production could limit the impact of weak regional demand."
Aug 2021;"Domestic Travel Pushes Russian Fuel Output to Record Heights";"A surge in domestic passenger flights has propelled Russian jet fuel production to record levels in August, as pent-up demand knits together the world’s most far-flung country.Jet output averaged 41,700 metric tons per day, or 333,600 barrels per day, in the first 18 days of the month,according to official Russian energy ministry data cited by ATR, a Moscow-based consultancy. Production is slightlyhigher than the record of 326,000 b/d cranked out in June, 2018 when Russia was gearing up to host the WorldCup for soccer ( JFI Aug.6'18 ). It also beats the 320,000 b/d posted in July, 2019.Russians are flying within the country like never before ( JFI Jul.30'21 ). This week Rosaviatsia, the industryregulator, announced that the number of domestic flights in July reached a staggering 127,400, a 30% increase on2019 levels for the month and a record based on analysis of data in recent years. In June, the number of domesticflights totaled 122,300, according to the regulator.International travel is also staging a comeback. In July the number of flights to and from foreign destinations wasnearly 102,000, up from 75,600 tracked in June. August is likely to surpass July as Russian airlines relaunch a slewof foreign routes that had been grounded in the pandemic limbo.Catch-Up MonthRefineries have responded to the demand spike by churning out aviation fuel. August output is 8.3% higher thanJuly thanks in large part to an operational restart at Taneco, an ambitious refiner belonging to Tatneft, and morevolumes from a handful of Rosneft-operated facilities.Downstream operations in July were hampered by several refinery outages, which created some tightness in jetfuel supply and led to acute regional shortages of gasoline that prompted a state intervention ( NC Jul.15'21 ).Generally, Russia has limited spare capacity for gasoline but a glut of middle distillate production. In January-Junenearly two-thirds of Russia’s 1.6 million b/d diesel output was exported, federal customs data show.Strong growth in civil aviation demand has meant less jet fuel is available for exports. Rail-based exports this yearhave been on a steady decline, reaching a nadir of 770 tons per day (6,160 b/d) in Aug. 1-17. In February exportsby railcar totaled 2,820 tons per day (22,560 b/d). This data does not include about 24,100 b/d produced atNovatek’s condensate splitter on the Gulf of Finland in the first half of the year, all of which was understood to beexported by ship.Domestic sales of jet fuel currently offer a premium to the export netback. The average price for jet in centralRussia was 49,380 rubles ($665) per metric ton, or $83 per barrel. This compares with export parity of 48,000rubles per ton for the Slavneft refinery, one of the country’s largest producers of jet fuel located near the port of St.Petersburg. Rosneft’s Achinsk refinery in central Siberia could only expect 37,000 rubles for a ton of exported fuel.Soaking Up SurplusWith the domestic jet fuel market fully supplied, deliveries to the civil aviation industry are starting to recede asdomestic travel subsides. Airports appear to have been sufficiently stocked ahead of August, and the late-summertravel boom will end once Russian schools open their doors on Sep. 1.Surplus jet is getting soaked up by Rosreserv, the state-owned firm that stockpiles a gamut of wholesale goods,ranging from oil products to dry foods like rice and pasta. ATR data shows that deliveries to Rosreserv averaged1,940 tons per day in Aug. 1-17, up from an average 613 tons per day in July. The agency is apparentlyreplenishing stocks after a considerable drawdown in June-July to make up for refinery outages.Gary Peach, New York"
Aug 2021;"Pandemic Jitters Halt Massive Oil Price Rebound";"Oil prices recouped some of the ground they lost in August until pandemic jitters ended a massive three-day rally onThursday. International benchmark Brent gained $4.62 per barrel to end the week at $71.07/bbl, while US price-pinWest Texas Intermediate rose $3.73/bbl to close at $67.42/bbl. A tropical storm heading for the US Gulf Coastprompted energy companies to shut in offshore platforms and prepare to close refineries, which puts markets onstronger footing heading into September. Factors behind the short-lived rally included short-covering after severalsessions of steep losses the week prior, approval of the Pfizer vaccine by the US Food and Drug Administration, anexplosion at an oil platform in Mexico, and a weakening dollar.An uneven, volatile recovery is complicating Opec-plus efforts to manage oil markets. The producer coalition meetson Sep. 1 to decide output policy at a time when the global economic recovery has come under serious threat fromrising infections due to the Covid-19 Delta variant. The group had agreed to ramp up production by 400,000 barrelsper day a month from August to at least December in a bid to hold prices around the $70/bbl level. With theInternational Energy Agency shaving 500,000 b/d from its global demand forecast for the second half of this year,the extra supplies may overshoot expectations about demand if the Delta variant further undermines the economicoutlook in coming weeks.The tropical storm brewing in the Caribbean and bearing down on the US Gulf Coast throws a wrench into US jetfuel fundamentals. US jet fuel markets were evenly balanced at 1.4 million b/d as sales receded from their post-pandemic high and refiners kept a lid on output. The summer travel season is winding down and some airlines arefeeling the impact of the Delta variant, with bookings down and cancellations rising. Imports surged to 275,000 b/dand there are more cargoes on the way. At least seven vessels are due to land at West Coast ports in the secondhalf of August. Incoming supplies replenished West Coast tanks, helping to lift overall US stocks by nearly 1.5million barrels to 44.4 million bbl. East Coast stocks climbed by 700,000 bbl and were one-third higher than 2020levels amid strong pipeline flows and imported supplies.US jet fuel prices continue to outperform levels in Europe and Asia, widening their lead this week with average spotprices approaching $2 per gallon. Underlying diesel futures regained all the ground they lost last week at the sametime that jet spreads tightened in the major trading regions, lifting outright quotes into the $1.85-$2.01/gallon range.Differentials versus diesel futures narrowed by 2¢ to a 23¢/gallon discount on the Gulf Coast and to 17¢ below theprint in New York Harbor. A 10¢ surge on the West Coast lifted Los Angeles jet differential to just 7¢ below Octoberdiesel futures, widening the arbitrage window across the Pacific.European flight departures stayed roughly stable at around 29% below pre-pandemic levels, according to networkmanager Eurocontrol, holding jet fuel consumption at only 50%-55% of 2019 volumes due to the lack of long-haultraffic. Trans-Atlantic flights could suffer a further blow if the European Union puts restrictions on US travelers dueto the surge in Covid-19 cases. A total of five cargo deals were concluded in Europe’s price-setting market-on-close trading window over the past week. Unipec was the seller in four of those deals, offloading two parcels onAug. 24 to Swiss trader Vitol for delivery into Rotterdam from early to mid-September. Unipec also sold a parcel onAug. 25 to Shell, with volumes to be delivered into Rotterdam at the middle of September. Unipec sold a fourthparcel on Aug. 26 to Glencore that is due to arrive in Rotterdam from early to mid-September. The fifth parcel thattraded in the window was sold by Vitol on Aug. 26 to BP, with the volumes arriving in Le Havre during the first halfof next month.Asian jet markets gained modest ground as air traffic jumped in two of the region’s largest aviation markets. Thebenchmark Singapore spot price differential rose by a slight 2¢/bbl from a week ago to a premium of 7¢/bbl toSingapore quotes on Aug. 26. The new LR3 tanker <em>Dimitrios</em> was laden and recently floating offLuanda, Angola, according to data intelligence company Kpler. The tanker had loaded 40,000 tons of jet on Jul. 22from Pengerang in southern Malaysia near trading and pricing hub Singapore, Kpler added. The arbitrage flow ofjet from East of Suez to west of the canal tumbled by 158,000 tons from the previous week to 243,000 tons in theweek starting Aug. 23, according to Kpler. Of those volumes, 95,000 tons loaded from Saudi Arabia, 84,000 tonsloaded from Japan and 63,000 tons loaded from India, Kpler added. The cargoes are expected to arrive in Europeand the US West Coast, Hawaii or Alaska from Sep.13 through Oct. 2.Prompt jet demand was bolstered by increases in airline capacity in Asia's regional aviation markets. Scheduledairline capacity for the week of Aug. 23 jumped by 8% from the previous week in Northeast Asia and spiked by 18%in Southeast Asia, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. Airline capacity in China recovered strongly in theweek of Aug. 23, leaping by 12% from the previous week, OAG noted. But in a sign of how jet fuel burn per flighthas dropped due to the pandemic, international flights made up less than 1% of all airline capacity in China, OAGadded. Short-haul domestic flights burn significantly less jet than longer-haul international flights. European Quarterly Jet Fuel Swaps Quotes Quarter Chg.

Strong distillate demand continues to drive utilisation rates as well as increasing dieselfuel consumption. Increased consumer purchases of goods are driving diesel demand as freight isincreasingly used to make deliveries, this trend is expected to persist through theremainder of 2021. Rising refinery rates are pushing jet fuel inventories higher, placing downwards pressureon the market.

But GDP in the Euro Area has lagged is forecast to remain below its pre-pandemic level until mid-2022.* Over the past quarter, inflation has surprised on the upside, especially in the US, with the demand boost from theAmerican Rescue Plan, combined with other factors such as rising commodity prices and supply chain disruptions.CPI inflation at 5.3 per cent in June was the highest since July 2008.

Aug 2021;"A path to global economic health is in sight";"T he northern hemisphere is sweating through a second long summer of Covid-19. As the Delta variant gainsground in the US, Europe and even China, the contours of the global economic challenge are now clear.Libertarians and statists should lay down their arms, since there is no fundamental trade-off between lives andlivelihoods. Through different strategies, the countries that have best controlled the virus have generally enjoyedgreater freedom and better economic performance over the past 18 months.Emerging data from the second quarter shows how China and South Korea, both of which originally opted for harshlockdowns, have comfortably exceeded their pre-pandemic peak levels of output, unlike large European countries.They were also able to relax restrictions more than places where the virus was much more prevalent.Almost as important as keeping a lid on infections has been compensating those hit financially by Covid-19.Practically no level of economic support has been too much. Advanced economies quickly understood this featureof the pandemic. Emerging and developing countries did not have the same scope for extremely cheap borrowing.The US performed better than Europe on this front, although tourism-dependent economies such as Spain andGreece could have done little more.Errors made by countries in the crisis phase of the pandemic or in cyclical management of the recovery can largelybe rectified in years to come. Divergences of economic performance ought to narrow over time. Ultimately, whatwill matter for the world economy and for individual countries will be to minimise the longer-term economic scarsfrom the pandemic.The extent of such damage is highly uncertain. But 2021 has brought four pieces of news, three of which areencouraging. These help explain the brighter global economic outlook since January and the change in theoptimal strategy from strict containment of coronavirus towards coexistence.The first is that long-term damage will almost certainly be far smaller than that after the 2008-09 financial crisis. Thepandemic hit economies almost as a shock out of the blue rather than as the result of a fundamental problem inthe system that needed fixing. Returning as close as possible to the pre-pandemic economy is something to becelebrated rather than feared.Second, we now know that modern advanced economies can adapt much better to pandemic-related restrictionsthan appeared possible in the first wave of the virus. The eurozone economy, for example, contracted 14.6 percent in the two quarters of 2020 but, after recovering sharply last summer, lost only 0.9 per cent of its size duringthe six months of the second wave of infections. For advanced economies, this has allowed governments toimpose restrictions without the same fear of economic catastrophe that were evident when Covid-19 first struck.Effective vaccines are the third boon for the long-term health of the global economy. They raise the prospect thatpeople can live their lives more normally without fear of permanent, severe restrictions on socialising andmovement. There are concerns about waning immunity, but most of what we have learnt about vaccination hasimproved the longer-term economic outlook.The one important piece of bad news has been the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, renderinglockdowns less effective for long-term virus control. Asia and Australia's struggles in containing rising case numbersnow, having operated successful lockdowns in earlier waves, highlight the near impossibility of eliminating this virusfrom circulation. Reduction to a manageable level is instead the new aim.For global health and economics, we need to ensure the success of an international vaccination drive. A rapidreduction in Delta infections has occurred in Portugal, the Netherlands and the UK without the same level ofhospitalisations or restrictions on freedom that characterised earlier waves of the virus.As Gita Gopinath, the IMF chief economist, said last week, any vaccination programme cannot be limited to the richworld. ""The recovery is not assured until the pandemic is beaten back globally,"" she said, calling again for 1bndoses to be shared this year by countries with surplus supplies.Up to now, there has been scant evidence of hoarding by rich-country govfirst ernments, despite some initialshortages of vaccine supplies and their duty to protect their own populations. But as supplies improve, theimperative will be to vaccinate the entire world. With such large economic returns from reducing the health impactsof Covid-19, and very low costs of vaccine production, there can never have been such a good investment for theglobal economy.Naturally, there are still big risks. Variants might emerge which escape the protection offered by vaccination.Immunity appears to wane over time, so even greater vaccine supply is likely to be needed. Vaccine hesitancyraises the prospect of severe health consequences even with effective vaccines available.Despite these dangers, the likelihood is that we are moving into a durable recovery phase after an acute crisis. Theeffectiveness of Covid vaccines has enabled us to see a clear path out of the crisis. It is still strewn with hurdles, butwe should be optimistic. Humans are good at jumping over them.chris.giles@ft.comWhat matters to individual countries is minimising the long-term scars of the pandemic"
Aug 2021;"Stable growth boon for global economy: China Daily editorial";"chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2021-08-22 20:17An assembly worker is seen at a factory of a cable export company in Tangshan city, North China's Hebei provinceon Aug 21, 2021. [Photo/Xinhua]Since there is still no sign that the global economy will return to normal any time soon, thanks to the resurgence ofthe pandemic caused by the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus, the stability of China's economy matters agreat deal to its eventual recovery and how the global fight against the virus proceeds.In the past seven months, China's foreign trade increased 24.5 percent over the same period last year, with itsexports rising 24.5 percent and imports 24.4 percent. Those rates are the highest in the past decade. Its exports toits traditional foreign markets such as the United States, European countries and Japan rose by 22.6 percent in thepast seven months over the same period last year while its exports to emerging markets such as Southeast AsianNations, South American and African countries expanded by 26.5 percent.It is obvious that China's economy is continuing to integrate further with the world. A lack of daily necessities wouldhave greatly affected people's lives in many countries without imports from China. In other words, China's stableeconomic performance has helped the world to make up for the losses the pandemic has caused the majoreconomies.China used foreign capital of 672.19 billion yuan ($103.38 billion) from January to July, which was an increase of25.5 percent over the same period last year, and a rise of 26.1 percent over the same period of 2019. If calculatedin US dollars, the rate stands at 30.9 percent.This suggests that China is still a major destination for foreign investment. It also indicates that the country, the onlyone of all major economies to have successfully kept the virus at bay, has provided opportunities for thedevelopment of transnational companies.During the same period, China's direct investment in developing countries along the Belt and Road routes stood at11.29 billion yuan, an increase of 9.9 percent over the same period last year. China's investment has considerablysupported the growth of these economies which have been facing difficulties because of the pandemic.In addition, China's stable economic recovery has helped ease the pressure of inflation globally. Quantitativeeasing by the US and some major Western countries has pushed the prices of commodities to new highs, whichhas fueled inflation pressure all over the world.It is China's efforts to digest the cost of raw materials during the production process that has relieved the pressureof inflation on countries. For instance, the price of China's exports to the US increased 2.7 percent, much lowerthan the 5 percent inflation rate of local daily necessities.China's continued endeavors to further reform and opening-up can therefore be expected to contribute to thehealthy development of the world economy."
Aug 2021;"Slow Covid vaccination to cost global economy USD2.3 trillion - study";"(Alliance News) - The slow rollout of coronavirus vaccines will cost the global economy USD2.3 trillion in lostoutput, a report released Wednesday found.The Economist Intelligence Unit's study found that emerging and developing economies, whose vaccine rolloutsare far behind those of wealthier countries, will bear the brunt of those losses.The report comes as advanced nations move towards providing booster shots to their populations while theinternational effort to provide vaccines for poorer nations remains inadequate.The study calculated that countries which fail to vaccinate 60% of their populations by mid-2022 will suffer thelosses over the 2022-2025 period.""Emerging countries will shoulder around two-thirds of these losses, further delaying their economic convergencewith more developed countries,"" the EIU said.It warned the delayed rollout of vaccines could fuel resentment, increasing the risk of social unrest in developingeconomies.The Asia-Pacific Region will be the worst hit in absolute terms, accounting for nearly three-quarters of the losses.But as a percentage of GDP, sub-Saharan Africa will suffer the worst losses.Around 60% of the population of higher-income countries received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine asof late August, compared to just one percent in poorer nations, according to the study. Two doses are required tobe fully vaccinated for most shots.""Vaccination campaigns are progressing at a glacial pace in lower-income economies,"" it said.The report's author, Agathe Demarais, said the international effort to provide coronavirus vaccines to poor nations,Covax, has failed to live up to its even modest expectations.""There is little chance that the divide over access to vaccines will ever be bridged"" with rich countries providing onlya fraction of what is needed, she said in a statement.""Finally, the focus in developed economies is shifting towards administering booster doses of coronavirusvaccines, which will compound shortages of raw materials and production bottlenecks,"" she added.The EIU said its study was conducted by combining its in-house forecasts for vaccination timelines in around 200countries with GDP growth forecasts.source: AFPCopyright 2021 Alliance News Limited.

Sep 2021;"Supply chain hurdles continue to mar global economic growth";"New Delhi, Sept. 3 -- The global economy remains in the doldrums, with manufacturing growth continuing to losemomentum. The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to a six-month low of 54.1in August. In July, the reading was 55.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion and below the threshold points tocontraction.Although the number is in the expansion zone, a broad-based dip has been recorded in manufacturing activities indev-eloped and emerging markets.What is more worrying is that global growth continues to be hampered by severe supply chain disruptions. Thiswas highlighted by a further marked increase in average vendor lead times in August. In fact, the increase could becompared with that of June's series record, said the PMI report. Also, companies reported transportation delays andshortages developing for inputs and raw materials, it added. Consequently, the output sub-components fell by morethan the headline PMIs for many key economies.According to analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities Ltd, the spread of the delta variant amid still-lowvaccination rates in many Asean (Association of South East Asian Nations) economies and China's zero-tolerancecovid strategy have prompted governments to impose restrictions and order factory/port closures. ""As a result, rawmaterial shortages, port congestion and unavailability of containers have lengthened lead times, at a time whenchip inventories are already running low,"" said a Nomura report dated 1 September.It should be noted that the suppliers' delivery times sub-index component of the PMI declined in eight out of nineAsian economies in August and remained below 50. Since Asia is a global manufacturing hub, supply constraints,if sustained for a long period, do not bode well for global economic revival. In simple terms, input shortages andlow inventories would result in production cuts and delayed shipments.""The fall in China's index to an 18-month low confirmed that the recovery there is coming off the boil, with supplyshortages worsening amid Asia's outbreak and demand also weakening,"" said Jennifer McKeown, head of globaleconomics service at Capital Economics.According to McKeown, there is early evidence that the adverse effects of these shortages may have peaked asindices of suppliers' delivery times and input prices have stopped rising. That said, they still remain at elevatedlevels. McKeown cautioned that supply constraints won't be fixed fast.Meanwhile, business confidence among manufacturers dipped to a 10-month low in August, not surprising in thebackdrop of the supply shortage. But manufacturers don't seem to have lost hope as the sentiment index is aboveits long-term average, say economists. For now, stranded shipments must begin to move fast for global growth togain pace.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Sep 2021;"European jet fuel spot values flatten on subdued buying";" LONDON (ICIS)--The European jet kerosene spot market is still weighed down bywaning buying interest, in spite of improving flight operating rates and disruption at the USoil production facilities in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. Outright jet spot values remained supported by improving ICE Brent crude futures,hovering around the $72/bbl mark. Sentiment is lifted by supply disruptions after slammedinto the US Gulf Coast, causing power outages and flooding disrupting nearly 95% ofprevailing oil production in the region. Prompt-month crack spread to rolling Brent has strengthened to $7.5/bbl this week, moresupply-driven than demand, as reduced throughputs and the approaching autumnturnaround season are likely to restrict return of length in the market. That said, nearing the historically healthy $10/bbl mark, refineries are likely to feelincentivised to produce more jet fuel in the near term. Stronger sentiment, however, has been hit by slow trading activity seen in the last fewweeks, as summer lull dented any significant deals of barges and cargoes in the spot space,keeping differentials static in mid-twenties. A similar trend was mirrored this week although a major source mentioned that cargoessaw some interest from bidders. While the impact from Ida has tightened key US chemicals and polymers markets, itfailed to spark up the European jet fuel market, especially as the inventory levels in theremained high, squeezing export opportunities. A market source said not many vessel deviations have been seen as a result ofHurricane Ida. Meanwhile, arbitrage from Asia has improved, as Eastern markets are facing setbacksfrom renewed lockdowns and surging cases denting local demand, pushing additionalvolumes into West. With the peak travel season nearing its end, growth in flight operating rates has beencapped down to single digits, at around 71% of 2019 levels. According to the latest data from Eurocontrol, domestic traffic in August 2021was 29% lower versus the same month in 2019. Domestic traffic peaked on 27 August,showing a 28% fall against the same period in 2019. That said, after a continuous increase since mid-May, air traffic levels stabilised in earlyAugust and has only managed to improve marginally since then, Eurocontrol suggests. Some regional airline operators - such as Ryanair - are optimistic of the recovery,especially post-reopening of travel in Europe and the easing of restrictions for fullyvaccinated UK travellers supporting significant increase in demand."
Sep 2021;"Airlines to lower fuel surcharges on int'l routes in October";" 16 September 2021 (Yonhap News Agency) South Korean airlines will lower fuel surcharges on internationalroutes next month as jet fuel prices rise at a slower pace, industry sources said Thursday.Starting Oct. 1, the surcharge for one-way tickets on international routes will range from 4,800 won (US$4) to36,000 won, depending on the routes, according to the sources.The Level 4 rate is down from the Level 3 range of 6,000 won to 54,000 won for this month.In April, rising jet fuel prices prompted local air carriers to begin imposing fuel surcharges after a one-year hiatus.Fuel surcharges on international routes had stayed at zero since April last year due to low oil prices sparked by theCOVID-19 pandemic.Local carriers' surcharges depend on the level of jet fuel prices traded on the Singaporean market.If the average jet fuel price on the Singapore spot market rises over $1.50 per gallon during the past month, SouthKorean airlines are allowed to impose fuel surcharges starting one month later.Jet fuel prices averaged at $1.78 per gallon on the Singapore market for the one month to Sept. 15. The averageprice is the basis for setting jet fuel surcharges for October.If jet fuel prices drop below the threshold, no surcharge is collected. There are 10 levels of surcharges, dependingon the length of the route."
Sep 2021;"Inflation Fears Drive Oil Prices Higher";"Oil prices continued their upward trend as inflation fears pulled more investors into commodity markets that areseen as a relative safe haven in times of global economic stress. Oil prices are an efficient hedge against inflation,and can be a profitable investment channel in their own right for funds that can cope with higher volatility.â€œCommodity markets are the best-performing asset class year-to-date, with gains of more than 25%,â€Rabobank commodity strategist Ryan Fitzmaurice said in a note Thursday. International benchmark Brent gainedanother $1.58 per barrel this week to close at $77.25/bbl Thursday, while US domestic price-pin WTI rose 69Â¢/bblto end the week at $73.30/bbl.Brent futures are up 37% since the start of the year. US inflation topped 5% for the fourth month in a row in Augustas the post Covid-19 recovery continues. The Eurozone is seeing prices rise at their fastest rate in over a decade.Higher energy prices are a major contributor to inflation in Europe with the European Commission now accusingRussia of deliberately withholding gas supplies from the market in order to shore up prices. Several householdenergy suppliers have gone bust in the UK, which is also now facing gasoline and diesel shortages after Brexitlabor rules compounded a shortage of fuel tanker drivers. BP was forced to close some of its branded servicestations in the UK on Thursday when Exxon also confirmed shortages of some fuels in its retail network. Most UKairports are served by pipeline rather than road tankers, making jet fuel supply disruptions far less likely, especiallygiven the weakened state of airline fuel demand across Europe. Flight numbers were down 30% versus 2019 levelsin the week to Sep. 23, according to Eurocontrol, with 86% of flights still within Europe and using comparatively littlefuel. The US will finally allow fully vaccinated European travelers to enter the country from the start of November.US passport holders have been allowed to travel to and from Europe since mid-June. Cargo premiums are rising inanticipation of November's restart of trans-Atlantic air travel. Into-wing heavyweight BP paid a $25 per ton premiumto October ICE gasoil futures for 30,000 tons of jet delivered into Le Havre Oct. 2-6 by Chinaâ€™s Unipec inWednesdayâ€™s window. That is up from October plus $21/ton traded last Friday when Swiss trader Vitol boughtSep. 30-Oct. 4 barrels into Le Havre also from Unipec. Vitol bought another cargo from Unipec for Sep. 27-Oct. 1delivery into Rotterdam the same day at a Platts-related price. Firmer prompt prices are encouraging destockingwith closely watched jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp falling to a 22-week low of 879,000 tons on Sep.23, according to Insights Global.

Sep 2021;"European Aviation Urged to Tackle Climate Change Adaptation";"Aviation needs to work on its climate resilience at the same time as accelerating its decarbonization efforts.The UN’s International Panel on Climate Change warned last month that some global warming was alreadyirreversible and that time is running out to stabilize the climate ( JFI Aug.13'21 ). Emissions of greenhouse gasesfrom human activities have already warmed the earth by 1.1°C since 1850-1900. Current environmental policiesmean the world is set to exceed its carbon budget to stay within 1.5°C by around 2030 and within 2°C by the mid-2040s.Europe's Eurocontrol held a stakeholder forum this week to discuss the impact of climate change on aviation. Theevent followed the network manager's Sep. 6 publication of a summary report on Climate Change Risks forEuropean Aviation prepared by infrastructure planning specialist Egis and the UK Meteorological Office.That study found thunderstorms already responsible for 7.5% of total en-route flight delays in Europe with thestrength of summer storms increasing due to climate change. More than 1 million extra kilometers were flown in2019 to avoid major storms, adding at least 6,000 metric tons to fuel burn and generating 19,000 tons of additionalcarbon emissions.Mitigation and adaptation are no longer separate, said Airports Council International (ACI) Europe’s senior directorfor sustainability, environmental protection and legal affairs Juliana Scavuzzi at Thursday’s forum. She said 69% ofACI’s global members reported they had been impacted by adverse weather events, patterns and conditions. Thefigure was lowest in Europe but still more than half. Scavuzzi urged airports to urgently conduct risk assessments --especially into how climate change will affect supply chains, including fuel, and airport infrastructure.Wilder WeatherSenior executive adviser at Avinor, Olav Mosvold Larsen, shared some of the state-owned Norwegian airportoperator’s extensive work to adapt to warmer, wetter and wilder weather, including adding runway/taxiway drainageto cope with heavier rains. Norway’s 20 coastal airports are more at risk from storm surges than rising sea levels soneed better storm defenses. Larsen shared a photo of an island heliport completely washed away by a recentstorm. Airports in the north of Norway are already seeing runway damage from melting permafrost, while Oslo’srunway needed to be hosed down this summer to cool it down enough for planes to take off.Rising sea levels are a major concern for Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport which is already 4.5 meters below sea leveland reliant on an elaborate drainage system and pumps. Schiphol’s program manager for corporate responsibilityDenise Pronk said flight disruptions were increasing due to climate change: thunderstorms, extreme rainfall, shiftingwinds and heat were causing problems. Pronk also said the fire brigade had to hose down the runway at Schipholthis summer to stop the tarmac melting. She suggested the changing jet stream could result in trans-Atlantic flightsfrom Europe to the US needing to use more fuel.The Eurocontrol report, which will be published in full next week, details Europe’s short-term weather outlook. It alsolooks at how both storms and stronger upper winds are likely to affect the region’s flight operations, what rising sealevels will mean for Europe’s many low-lying airports and how climate change could change tourism in the region.Some impacts could be seen as beneficial. Shorter flight times could save at least 55,000 tons per year of jet fueland almost 175,000 tons/yr of carbon dioxide by 2050 under Egis’ analysis.Trans-Atlantic flights are set to be one totwo minutes' shorter and flights from Europe to Asia two to five minutes' shorter by 2050 because of changing upperwind patterns. But storm surges, high rainfall and flooding are likely to cost billions in disruptions if the industry failsto prepare. Weather-related delays already cost the European air industry €2.2 billion ($2.6 billion) in 2019. Therewas some discussion at the forum about how airport workers, particularly fueling operatives, would be able tocontinue to work during extreme weather episodes -- especially heat.Jet fuel markets are already facing frequent disruptions from extreme weather caused by climate change. Vastswaths of US refining capacity are still off line this week after Hurricane Ida pummeled the US Gulf Coast ( related ).European fuel traders see regular disruptions to inland barge flows caused by both droughts and flooding, whichare becoming more commonplace.Kerry Preston, London"
Sep 2021;"European jet spot market pressurised by rallying crude, seasonal slowdown";" LONDON (ICIS)--Spiking upstream prices continued to suppress the European jetkerosene spot market amid lacklustre trading, even though sentiments remained buoyedby the November reopening of the Transatlantic route. Bookings to the US have spiked, with steady growth in intra-European flights lendingupside, even though routes to Asia remain low. Waning macroeconomic indicators, in addition torallying upstream Brent crude futures, pose serious headwinds for an aviation sectorstruggling to cover losses incurred during the pandemic. That said, any substantial impact on activity in the open market trading window is yet totake effect. Buyers are adopting a cautious stance amid a seasonal slowdown in demandduring the winter months, in addition to concerns over potential coronavirus mutations. At the same time, the outlook for winter months remains clouded by seasonal slowdownand concerns around future coronavirus mutations, with the market cautious in jet fuelbuying. Despite slow trading, outright values continued to mirror gains in upstream Brent crudefutures, rallying at around the $78/bbl mark on Wednesday 29 September, after touching $80/bblearlier on Tuesday, and pushing weekly averages up by 5% from the week prior. Market close values for jet barges on a free on board (FOB) Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) basis, were assessed at $688.125/tonne, while jet cargoes CIF(cost, insurance & freight) NWE (northwest Europe) dropped to $689.25/tonne on Tuesday28 September. Rising jet fuel prices continue to pressure airlines' revenues amid limited operatingrates, with the impact likely to be exacerbated as any uptick in demand will pressure prices. There has been an uptick in traffic on pan-Europe short-haul flights following theease of travel restrictions. This has seen them remain steady at over 70% of 2019 operatingcapacities for most of Q3. In addition to this, the steady growth in industry-wide cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs),which rose by 25% in the three months ending July 2021, has boosted market sentiments,although macroeconomic factors continue to harbour downside. Soaring energy costs and logistic issues have compelled refineries to reconsider theiroperating rates, with some undergoing extended maintenance schedules. This has left one majorUK refinery struggling to operate in the current environment. Meanwhile, increased inflows from east of Suez, with a total of 800kt scheduled to hitnorthwest Europe in October, could disturb the supply-demand balance if buying fails to pickup pace. The prompt-month crack spread - a measure of refinery margin - has jumped up to $8.5-9.0/bbl for October this week, aided by improved market sentiments, despite remainingbelow historical healthy levels of around the $18/bbl mark. The recent spike in prices following multi-year low inventory,tight supply and low wind generation has impacted most industrial units, with high inflationrates and waning global economic growth prospects posing threats for aviation recovery. Meanwhile, market players remain concerned over the sustainability of aviation demand,as the seasonal slowdown and concerns over a potential rise in coronavirus cases duringthe winter months could soften rates of consumption. According to a report published by European airport trade body, ACI Europe, after exitingthe peak summer holiday period, passenger traffic is no longer improving in many marketsand is either plateauing or even decreasing again. Overall, the last quarter of the year is traditionally slower in terms of demand, andthe current macroeconomic indicators pertain to slowing economic growth, increasing inflationrates and the ongoing energy crunch combining to induce uncertainty in the market."

Sep 2021;"Global economy heading towards stagflation - leading macroeconomic";"Mohamed A. El-ErianMohamed A. El-Erian, president at Queens' College, Cambridge University, shared his articleon how the global economy is heading towards stagflation. The global economy was recovering slowly from thecoronavirus pandemic but a surge in Delta-variant related cases in the US and China has slowed down the growth.Spending in several sectors including leisure and transportation has declined, while worker shortage is growing inadvanced economies leading to higher and persistent inflation. The higher inflation rates are putting pressure oncentral banks to scale back stimulus measures and structural policies that are needed to boost productivity andensure long-term economic growth. Some experts believe the stagflationary trends will disappear once Deltavariant-related cases and supply chain disruptions subside. Others, however, believe that the stagflationary trendswill intensify as stimulus packages and unemployment benefits expire. El-Erian opined that either scenario may notpersist in the future and called for cooperation among national and international financial entities to strengthenregulation measures that will ease the inflationary pressures and ensure financial stability. The stagflationary trendsindicate the need for comprehensive economic policy measures, he added. What to make of the stagflationarywinds blowing through the global #economy?For the reasons detailed here, they should be taken seriously, andare likely to be a feature of the journey but not of the destination?https://t.co/Ax8fRIjAqv#economy @ProSyn #inflation #stagflation - Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) September23, 2021 Christophe BarraudChristophe Barraud, chief economist at financial services firm Market Securities,shared an article on how European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers are expecting inflation to rise above projectedlevels signalling the need to end the (EURO)180tn ($2.16tn) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. The ECBplans to take a decision on the bond purchases in December projecting an inflation rate to ease in 2022-23.Policymakers at the ECB, however, opine that the inflation rate predicted by the ECB at 2.2% this year, 1.7% in2022 and 1.5% in 2023 are too low. Inflation may exceed 2% next year against the ECB policy that has estimatedinflation to undershoot the target. Supply chain bottlenecks, staff shortages and a steady influx of cash into theeconomy from private savings and stimulus programmes were contributing to the rise in inflation. The ECB,however, expects the supply chain bottlenecks to ease next year and commodity prices to decline leading to a fall ininflation rate after the current temporary rise. Experts, however, opine that inflation is not completely transitory aspredicted by the ECB and only a small number of transitory factors will be needed for inflation to remain abovepredicted levels. ???? #ECB braces for sticky inflation; eyes end of emergency stimulus, sources say -Reutershttps://t.co/JbXNWAQfpX - Christophe Barraud?? (@C_Barraud) September 23, 2021 John ApplebyJohnAppleby, chief economist at Nuffield Trust, an independent health think tank, shared an article on how the national influencersinsurance hike proposed by the government will impact the National Health Service (NHS) and care workers with atax bill of £900m ($1,232m). The UK government announced last week that contributions to national insurance willincrease by 1.25 percentage points to deal with the NHS backlog and pay for social care programmes. The tax hike,however, is expected to increase the burden on healthcare workers and their families, according to the article.Health and social care workers will need to pay 12% of the £7.4bn ($10.12bn) planned to be raised through the taxhike, while the remaining £900m ($1,232m) will be paid by nurses and other health care workers. NHS workers willhave to pay £315 ($431) more in taxes annually due to the tax hike. Healthcare workers are already facing financialpressures due to the rise in consumer prices and cuts in benefits programmes. Experts have opined that the taxhike should be reassessed as it will disproportionately impact low and middle income groups. As taxpayers healthand care staff were always going to contribute to the increase in funding for health and care, just as they do tofunding public services in general.

Oct 2021;"Europe jet fuel market eyes pace of aviation rebound for demand growth";"LONDON (ICIS)--The European jet kerosene market could see a decline in demand as the European aviationrecovery curve flattens, after the summer spike, with long-haul flights yet to rebound fully, clouding the near-termaviation fuel demand outlook.The regional recovery has lost momentum over the past two months, with total seat numbers in Europe at 67% of2019 levels in the week of 4 October barely changed from early August 2021 levels, according to CAPA Centre forAviation.The latest analysis submitted by air travel intelligence company OAG and CAPA suggests that capacity as apercentage of 2019 levels, however, has improved with each successive quarter of 2021 27% in Q1, 33% in Q2,64% for Q3 and is projected to reach 73% of Q4 2019 levels in the last quarter.That said, the overall recovery in aviation is largely capped by slower-than-expected growth in long-haul flights,while business and leisure travel is yet to reach full pace.An additional factor has been the stringency of international travel restrictions and the pace of the lowering orremoval of these.Approaching winter a traditionally slow requirement period from the aviation sector some demand for keroseneinto the gasoil pool for consumption in the heating industry cannot be ruled out.Gasoil demand is expected to pick up in October when temperatures will be dropping with not much spotavailability.Overall, the market in northwest Europe is indicated to be balanced.Amid cautious refinery runs and reduced throughputs, the prompt-month crack spread, a measure of refinerymargin, has firmed to a high of $12/bbl for October this week the highest since the pandemic hit the industry, albeitstill lower than the long-term healthy level of $18/bbl or higher.The market is in contango, which typically encourages buying for storage. However, the contango remains narrow,which could take away some of its impact.Trading in the open market window remains lacklustre, for barges and cargoes, with differentials improving frommid-September levels."
Oct 2021;"For investors: oil and gas, regaining prominence";" By Paulino SeoaneAs a result of the pandemic, one of the most affected sectors in 2020 was the entire energy sector,particularly the oil sector. The cancellation of flights, the fall in consumption and international trade strongly affected the world supply anddemand equation, leaving a supply surplus of 2 million barrels per day. This caused prices to fall from u$s 61 to u$s40 per barrel. At the floor of the pandemic, the price reached a low of $11.26 per barrel. Companies have taken anumber of measures to protect their balance sheets, from reducing capital expenditures, cutting back on sharebuyback programs to suspending dividend payments.The gradual exit from the pandemic and the restoration of global trade and tourist traffic rebalanced thesupply/demand equation. There was a strong recovery of oil prices from lows of US$ 12 to the current US$ 75, withprojections of increases up to US$ 90.The great recovery of the stock indexes was mostly concentrated in communications and technology companies,lagging behind oil companies that started to react from the strength of their balance sheets, which show anextraordinary cash generation that allows them to resume their dividend and share buyback programs. From arelative valuation point of view, the energy sector has a strong lag (measured through the Price Earnings multiple)with the S&P 500.Oil will continue to be the energy sector with the largest market share for several years as we can see in thefollowing chart. Renewable energies, which are growing strongly, have not yet reached the level of scale anddevelopment necessary to replace oil.Total primary energy demand by fuel type 2018-2040Leading companies in the sector:Exxon Mobil Corporation, an American company with more than 150 years of history. It is the largest publicly traded oil company in theworld. It is dedicated to the exploration and production of oil and gas in the USA and other countries. It operatesthrough Upstream, Downstream and Chemical segments. Worldwide, ExxonMobil markets fuels, lubricants andchemicals under four brands: Esso, Exxon, Mobil and ExxonMobil. It applies next-generation technologies to helpsafely and responsibly meet the world's growing needs for energy and high-quality chemicals. Maintained dividendsthroughout the pandemic and beat earnings expectations for the last 4 quarters. With oil on the rise, it is expectedto continue to surprise in the next few quarters.Chevron Corporation, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in integrated energy, chemicals and petroleum operations worldwide. Itoperates in both upstream and downstream segments. It offers a very good dividend and the possibility ofincreasing it, due to the strength of its business model and free-cash-flow. It currently allocates u$s 10.6 billion todividend payments (dividend yield =5.1%), this means that at current prices it would have an excess cash of u$s 9billion. It has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, given that its debt/equity is 0.3x. They are workingon renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture. It has carbon capture projects with Enterprise Products Partners(EPD) and Bunge (BG) for renewable fuels production.Royal Dutch Shell plc, energy and petrochemicals company with a global presence. It explores for and extracts oil and natural gas,markets and transports LNG (liquefied natural gas) and operates all the necessary upstream and midstreaminfrastructure to deliver gas to users. The company also operates in the markets for special purpose fuels,gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, carbon allowances, electricity and all types of petrochemicals: ethylene, polypropyleneand aromatics, monomers, solvents and detergents, among others. High margins and debt reduction confirm the oilcompany's strong earnings momentum, and management's focus is on increasing shareholder returns. The currentdividend yield is 4.7%, and the goal is to grow at 4% annually. Management was one of the first to take precautionsagainst the pandemic last year, since cutting the dividend last year, the company has already increased it 3 times.BP p.l.c. operates globally in the segments of Gas, Low Carbon Energy and oil production. It participates in the Natural Gasand Biofuels markets, onshore and offshore. It has wind and solar generation facilities, provides decarbonizationsolutions and carbon capture services. It is also engaged in the production and marketing of petroleum products,lubricants and is developing its own electric vehicle recharging unit. It is in a transition process to become anintegrated energy company with the clear objective of lowering its carbon footprint. The dividend yield (5%) and buyback program (5%) can ensure a shareholder return of 10%.In order to do so, an account can be opened with Balanz.

Oct 2021;"Palm oil used in SAF test flight in Indonesia";"Indonesia conducted its first test flight using jet fuel partially from palm oil as the country plans to commercialisethe fuel.The plane flew more than 100 km (62.14 miles) from the capital Jakarta to neighbouring city, Bandung. ""Indonesia, as the largest producer, of course needs to innovate the use of palm oil, including in the developmentof biodiesel, bio jet fuel and also continuing the D100 programme,"" economic minister Airlangga Hartarto told avirtual conference, referring to diesel made entirely from palm oil developed by state oil company Pertamina. Indonesia currently has a mandatory biodiesel programme with 30% palm oil content known as B30.The government is keen to expand the use of the vegetable oil for energy and slash fuel imports. The bio jet fuel used during the test flight only contained 2.4% palm content, but in a 2015 regulation, Indonesiahas a mandated this be increased to 5% by 2025. Although biodiesel promises significantly lower carbon emissions, the land clearance taking place to grow palm oilhas raised concerns among environmentalists about deforestation, with the European Union looking into banningbiodiesel containing palm. The Energy Ministry said the bio jet fuel market, assuming a daily consumption of 14,000 kilolitres, will have apotential market worth 1.1 trillion rupiah (€66 million) annually.""We need 120,000 kilolitres (of palm oil) per year,"" Dadan Kusdiana, director general of renewables at the energyministry said, adding more research was needed about commercialisation of the fuel.Our Biofuels International Conference and Expo takes place on Brussels on March 15-16 with some greatspeakers taking part.

International benchmark Brent finally settled at $81.95/bbl Thursday, up $3.43/bbl on theweek, while US price-pin West Texas Intermediate gained $3.27/bbl to end the reporting week at $78.30/bbl. Oilprices have doubled since last October while natural gas has jumped sixfold since the start of the year. Confrontingthis dizzying increase ahead of the winter has become a matter of urgency for government leaders to stave offpublic backlash. Washington has hinted that it might tap its strategic crude reserves or ban crude exports in a bid toease prices. Covid-19 restrictions on international travel are being steadily lifted in Europe. This week saw the UKtake 47 countries off its so-called ""red list,"" leaving only seven â€ Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, theDominican Republic, Haiti and Venezuela â€ still requiring an 11-day hotel-quarantine costing more than Â£2,000($2,726). The UK is also planning on replacing expensive PCR tests with much cheaper lateral flow tests. Europeanflight departures were only 28% below 2019 levels this week, according to Eurocontrol, the narrowest gap since thepandemic began last March. Traffic and fuel demand are set to jump next month when the US reopens its bordersto European passengers. Jet sellers have been emboldened by the prospect of stronger European airline fueldemand as more long-haul routes are added. European heavyweight Royal Dutch Shell was offering jet from twoLR2 tankers coming from China â€ the BW Thalassa and Navig8 Passion â€ at a $32 per metric ton premium toOctober ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures into Le Havre in Thursdayâ€™s window. Shell also named the LR2 Bneiderheading to Rotterdam from Kuwait earlier in the week. Window bids came in from Swiss trader Vitol at only Octoberplus $24/ton, although at least one cargo is rumored to have traded above that level outside of the window. Theweek saw just two cargo deals, both last Friday when Vitol bought two 30,000 ton parcels into Rotterdam Oct. 14-18 from Chinaâ€™s Unipec Platts-related. Brokers warn that imports are unlikely to exceed 1 million tons thismonth, adding to the pressure on stocks. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp fell to a six-month low of864,000 tons on Oct. 6, according to Insights Global. Stocks are now 13% below this time last year but still 35%above pre-pandemic levels. A wild ride in US jet fuel markets propelled prices to their highest levels in three years.Outright quotes gained 14Â¢ on the week in tandem with the surge in low-sulfur diesel futures, which reached $2.46per gallon on Thursday. Jet rates soared to $2.25-$2.32/gallon â€ a 20Â¢ jump from 30-day averages. Higherdiesel demand during the harvest season is likely to inflate the mid-distillate complex through the autumn. Jetspreads held relatively steady amid the daily market turmoil. Gulf Coast barrels were trading at 21Â¢ below theNovember screen, while the discount in New York Harbor narrowed slightly to 15Â¢ below diesel futures. Midwestspreads were the strongest at 13Â¢ below ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures as jet fuel competed with diesel forpipeline space. Market fundamentals tightened up in the week ended Oct. 1 with a spurt in sales to 1.69 million b/d,a gain of 267,000 b/d from last week. Steady recovery in flight numbers lifted September demand to 1.5 million b/dor 63% higher than 2020 rates for the month, according to Energy Information Administration data. Refinersboosted utilization rates to 89.6% of capacity but kept jet fuel output at 1.3 million b/d to concentrate on dieselsupplies. Stocks plunged by 1.3 million barrels to 41.3 million bbl â€ the lower end of the range over the last fewmonths. The Gulf Coast accounted for most of the stockdraw. Imports jumped by 26% from the prior week to nearly280,000 b/d with the arrival of several cargoes at ports near Los Angeles. The relative strength of US prices versusAsian markets has widened the arbitrage across the Pacific. Asia's jet market also firmed despite softer regionalair traffic, as more fuel left the region. Benchmark Singapore spot price differentials were just 2Â¢/bbl belowSingapore quotes on Oct. 7, up from a 5Â¢/bbl discount a week ago. Trading activity in the Platts Singapore tradingwindow has slowed with only 100,000 bbl of October-loading jet changing hands in the window this week â€ BPselling to Vitol â€ down from almost 1 million bbl last week. Vitol has also chartered the newly built LR2 tanker Jaarlito load around 96,000 tons of jet from South Korea on Oct. 12 for Europe. The east-west flow of jet through theSuez Canal hit 286,000 tons in the week starting Oct. 4, according to data firm Kpler, up from 192,000 tons lastweek. Of the volumes, 177,000 tons loaded in Kuwait, 65,000 tons in India and 44,000 tons in South Korea. Fallingair traffic in Northeast Asia more than offset the growth in South and Southeast Asia, dampening regional airlinefuel demand. Scheduled airline capacity for the week of Oct. 4 rose by 6.8% week on week in South Asia and 3.2%in Southeast Asia, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. But these increases were only a fraction of the3.9% decline in airline capacity in the giant Northeast Asian market. Northeast Asia, South Asia and SoutheastAsia are the three biggest regional aviation markets on the continent, outside of the Mideast. Northeast Asia aloneis many times the size of the other two regional markets combined. European Quarterly Jet Fuel Swaps Quotes (Bid/Offer Range in $/ton, c.i.f. NWE) Quarter Chg.

Oct 2021;"European Snapshot: EU Travel Pass Revives Regional Jet Demand";"European jet fuel demand reached a post-pandemic high of 3.5 million tons in July when the EU's digital travelpass was introduced. Departures from European airports bounced back to two-thirds of pre-crisis levels. Refinersboosted output to nearly 2 million tons to meet the surge in airline liftings. Imports jumped by 56% from June to 2.2million tons, with East of Suez arrivals accounting for more than half the volume. Higher demand drained jet fuelstocks in France, Italy and Spain â€ the main destinations for holiday travelers. The uptick in summer flightsdepleted stocks in smaller countries. Overall European tank levels fell by 420,000 tons from June to 10.5 milliontons. A surge in exports to 1.1 million tons also helped to rebalance the European market.

Oct 2021;"Oil prices climb to highest in years as COVID recovery, power generators";" October 18 -- Oil prices hit their highest in years on Monday as demand continues its recovery from the COVID-19pandemic, boosted by more custom from power generators turning away from expensive gas and coal to fuel oiland diesel.Brent crude oil futures rose 87 cents, or 1%, to $85.73 a barrel by 0111 GMT, the highest price since October 2018.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed $1.12, or 1.4%, to $83.40 a barrel, highest sinceOctober 2014.Both contracts rose by at least 3% last week.""Easing restrictions around the world are likely to help the recovery in fuel consumption,"" analysts from ANZ banksaid in a note on Monday.""The jet fuel market was buoyed by news that the U.S. will open its borders to vaccinated foreign travellers nextmonth. Similar moves in Australia and across Asia followed.""They added that gas-to-oil switching for power generation alone could boost demand by as much as 450,000barrels per day in the fourth quarter.Still, supply could also increase from the United States, where energy firms last week added oil and natural gas rigsfor a sixth week in a row as soaring crude prices prompted drillers to return to the wellpad.The U.S. oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose 10 to 543 in the week to Oct. 15, its highestsince April 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said last week.China's economy, meanwhile, likely grew at the slowest pace in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages,supply bottlenecks and sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks.The world's second-largest oil consumer issued a new batch of oil import quotas for independent refiners for 2021that show total annual allowances were lower than last year, a first reduction of import permits since these firmswere allowed into the market in 2015."
Oct 2021;"Petrol demand surged 9% above pre-pandemic level, diesel stayed 6.5%";"The demand for petrol surged 9% above the pre-pandemic level while that for diesel stayed 6.5% lower inSeptember, in a sign of divergent recovery paths the two fuels have taken following the easing of Covidrestrictions.Petrol sales rose 6.6% year-on-year in September while diesel rose barely 1% over last year, as per thepreliminary sales data from state-run oil companies that control nearly 90% of the fuel retail market.Jet fuel salesjumped 24% in a year but stayed 40% below the pre-pandemic level of September 2019, mirroring the struggle ofthe aviation sector as interactional flights continued to face severe restrictions. Cooking gas consumption, whichhas been robust through the pandemic, rose 4% year-on-year and 9% over 2019.A booming petrol sales suggestmore people are driving for work and pleasure. It also shows an increased preference for personal vehicles duringthe pandemic when people tend to avoid crowded buses and trains.Limited availability of public transport too has pushed more people towards personal vehicles, an industry executivesaid. This has also contributed to lower diesel sales as diesel powers much of public transport in India. Onceschools and colleges open up fully and more long-distance buses start plying, the diesel demand would rise, BPCLChairman Arun Singh said this week.A sustained increase in the share of petrol-driven vehicles on Indian roadsover the years has also contributed to faster recovery for petrol. An extended monsoon has impeded long-distancetransport in many places in September, hurting the demand for diesel, which makes up 40% of the country's oildemand.The festival season, beginning this month, is expected to rev up consumption in general and boost the fueldemand. But record-high fuel prices might weigh on sales. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com"
Oct 2021;"Winter Fuel Fears Drive Crude Gains";"Concerns over a shortage of diesel and other fuels heading into the winter heating season drove oil prices to freshmultiyear highs. Brent crude oil futures hit $86.10 per barrel in intra-day trade Thursday, its highest since 2018,amid fears the natural gas crisis could add 500,000 barrels per day or more to substitute diesel and fuel oildemand. High gas prices are also set to cut production of the fuels most needed as refiners in Europe trim dieselruns in response to spiking hydrogen feedstock costs. Oil prices fell back late Thursday after the US NationalWeather Service forecast a relatively mild winter in the worldâ€™s second-largest oil-consuming nation.A return of the La Nina weather pattern will bring above-normal temperatures to southern and central US states withonly the upper US Northeast expected to face lower-than-average temperatures. It can also mean milder and wetterweather in Europe although its effect is far less predictable. Brent ended the week 61Â¢/bbl higher at $84.61/bbl,while US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate ended the week up $1.19/bbl at $82.50/bbl. Traders stillbelieve $100/bbl is possible this winter. But for now Brentâ€™s relentless rally since August seems to have stalledat $85/bbl. Europeâ€™s jet demand is set to rise out of season next month when the US corridor reopens for fullyvaccinated travelers. Data from network manager Eurocontrol show European flight departures still 27% below2019 levels this week having been stuck there since August. Most flights are still domestic and regional â€ holdingjet fuel demand at barely half of pre-pandemic levels. Brokers say the low river Rhine water levels that are causingdisruptions to inland diesel and heating oil trade are having little impact on jet fuel. Reduced airline fuel upliftmeans the regionâ€™s normally busy pipeline network is still being underutilized. Jet stocks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) were barely changed on the week at 884,000 tons on Oct. 21, according to local monitorInsights Global, despite tankers arriving from Kuwait and South Korea. Jet ships left ARA for the UK and Irelandwhere jet kerosene is used as a winter heating fuel in predominantly rural areas that donâ€™t receive natural gas.The week saw three jet cargo deals in Europeâ€™s market-on-close (MOC) pricing window, all of them Plattsrelated. Royal Dutch Shell sold 30,000 tons from the Navig8 Passion due into Le Havre by the end of the month toTotalEnergies last Friday, when it also sold 30,000 tons from the BW Thalassa arriving in Le Have in earlyNovember to BP. Chinaâ€™s Unipec went on to sell 30,000 tons of jet from an unnamed vessel arriving inRotterdam by Nov. 10 to BP in Tuesdayâ€™s window. Unipec offered further Rotterdam barrels at a $34 per tonpremium to November ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures in Thursdayâ€™s MOC. The upward trajectory in US jetmarkets stalled on Thursday when the oil complex gave back some of its recent gains. Nymex diesel futures stillgained 2.5Â¢ per gallon on the week to close at $2.56 on Thursday, but weaker jet spreads offset some of thatgain. Differentials on both the Gulf Coast and in New York Harbor dipped by 1Â¢ to 24Â¢ and 18Â¢/gallon,respectively, below November diesel futures. Chicago jet spreads shed 2Â¢ to 15.5Â¢/gallon below the screen,while Los Angeles barrels held steady at an 18Â¢/gallon discount. Outright jet quotes in the $2.31-$2.39/gallonrange reached their highest level in three years. Jet prices have not been at those levels for a sustained periodsince 2014. At about 1.5 million b/d through most of October, jet demand is some 250,000 b/d below 2019 rates.Sales fell slightly to 1.4 million b/d in the week ended Oct. 15, but are poised for gains as airlines add moreinternational flights to Europe and elsewhere. Refinery output held steady at around 1.3 million b/d even asutilization rates fell to 84.7% of capacity amid ongoing refinery maintenance. Imports stayed around the 170,000 b/dmark and helped replenish stocks on the US West Coast. Overall jet stocks totaled 1.4 million barrels in mid-October and were at the lower end of their recent range. Tightness in mid-distillate markets means that jet fuel iscompeting with diesel and heating oil as refiners adjust their yields toward winter fuels. Asian jet marketsrebounded as overall air traffic grew in three of Asiaâ€™s largest regional aviation markets. The benchmarkSingapore spot price differential jumped by 19Â¢/bbl from a week ago to a premium of 20Â¢/bbl to Singaporequotes on Oct. 21. The flow of arbitrage jet from East of Suez to west of the canal dropped by 97,000 tons to240,000 tons in the week starting Oct. 18, according to data intelligence company Kpler. Of those volumes, 66,000tons loaded from Saudi Arabia, 65,000 tons each from Kuwait and India, while 44,000 tons originate from SouthKorea. The cargoes are expected to arrive in Europe and the US West Coast, Hawaii or Alaska from Nov. 4-29,Kpler added. Growing air traffic in Asia has given prompt jet demand a boost. Scheduled airline capacity for theweek of Oct. 18 rose by 0.7% from the previous week in Northeast Asia and jumped by 7.2% in Southeast Asia,according to aviation data analysis firm OAG. These increases outweighed the 0.9% dip from the previous week inSouth Asia. Trading activity has calmed down in the Platts Singapore trading window. No deals were done fromOct. 15-21 after several weeks of active trading, which had recently begun to taper off. European Quarterly Jet Fuel Swaps Quotes (Bid/Offer Range in $/ton, c.i.f.

Oct 2021;"Crude Oil Futures Hit Fresh Multi-Year Highs amid Tightening Supply";"Crude oil futures continued their upward climb during mid-morning trade in Asia Oct. 18, hitting fresh multi-yearhighs as the supply and demand outlook remained supportive for prices and investors weighed the possibility of areturn of Iranian oil.At 10:52 am Singapore time (0235 GMT), the ICE December Brent futures contract was up 94 cents/b (1.1%) fromthe previous close at $85.87/b, a high not seen since October 2018. The NYMEX November light sweet crudecontract rose $1.33/b (1.61%) at $83.60/b. It was last higher on October 2014.""[Last week was] the eighth consecutive week that crude oil has registered weekly gains, signaling strong bullishmomentum behind this rally,"" analysts at OCBC Treasury Research said in a note.""Easing restrictions around the world are likely to help the recovery in fuel consumption. The jet fuel market wasbuoyed by news that the US will open its borders to vaccinated foreign travelers next month,"" analysts at ANZResearch said.Investors were now eyeing Iranian talks that are set to resume this week, about four months after negotiations weredelayed as a new ultra conservative administration took office.Analysts said the likelihood of a return of Iranian oil to global export markets was unclear.""The timeline for more crucial diplomacy with the US remains unclear, but we still put the odds of an eventual dealjust above 50-50,"" Paul Sheldon, Platts Analytics chief geopolitical adviser, said Oct. 15. ""However, weacknowledge that Iran may no longer seek a deal under any realistic conditions.""US Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley warned of that possibility Oct. 13, saying: ""We have to prepare for a world... where Iran doesn't have constraints on its nuclear program and we have to consider options for dealing with that,even as we hope that we can get back to the deal.""Platts Analytics expects Iranian oil supply to rise to 3.66 million b/d by December 2022 if a deal is reached and USoil sanctions are removed. If talks are delayed further or collapse, the Iranian supply outlook would fall to 2.17million b/d. OutlookInvestors have piled long positions in the ICE Brent and NYMEX light sweet crude contracts in recent weeks, amidthe improving sentiment for crude oil. Speculative net longs in ICE Brent crude as of Oct. 5 stood at 332,677 lots,most recent data from ICE showed, a high not seen since March 16.Speculative net longs in the NYMEX light sweet crude contract meanwhile, stood at 326,605 lots as of Oct 12, ahigh not seen since July 31, according to data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.With oil prices hovering at such lofty heights, market watchers have said this will likely prompt a sharp return inproduction, particularly in the US, threatening the medium-term outlook for oil.TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said late last week that US shale industry may prove unable to resist rampingup activity to produce more crude oil.""They have been disciplined. But, at $85, I suspect they will forget,"" Pouyanne said. ""That's why we have cycles.""The US oil rig count has climbed almost continuously since hitting a pandemic low of 172 on Aug. 14, 2020, datafrom oil services firm Baker Hughes showed. The latest US oil rig count stood at 445 as of Oct. 15, up 12 on theweek. US crude oil output meanwhile, stood at 11.4 million b/d as of Oct. 8, US Energy Information Administrationdata showed."

Nov 2021;"China's slowdown raises questions for global economy";"Nov 10, 2021( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex) The Chinese economy, weighed down by electricity shortages and a vast real estate crisis, has lost its lusterrecently, to the point where economists are starting to question its impact on the global growth it has helped drivefor more than 20 years. The difficulties of the real estate sector in China triggered by the troubles of giant Evergrande could pose risks forthe world economy and affect the United States, the Federal Reserve warned in its report on financial stabilityreleased Monday. That is a marked change of tone from September, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell still believed the world'slargest economy was not really directly exposed to difficulties in China. Evergrande, estimated to be worth some 260 billion euros, is one of the biggest companies in China. Its financialsituation is closely scrutinized because its collapse would deal a serious blow to the growth of the Asian giant. The real estate sector is estimated to account for 25-30 percent of China's GDP. In the third quarter, grossdomestic product, suffering drag from the Evergrande crisis, grew by 4.9 percent year-on-year, down from 7.9percent in the second quarter. 'So far, the likes of the Evergrande debacle has been contained by Chinese official sector buffering,' said PadhraicGarvey, regional head of research for the Americas at financial institution ING. But he admitted there were 'unknown risks.' And he said the Fed cannot ignore the fact that 'China is right up there as a factor given its size, and the size of itsfinancial sector.' In October, the International Monetary Fund revised downwards its expansion forecasts for China, counting oneight percent, or down 0.1 percent. Its chief economist Gita Gopinath stressed that the institution is 'paying very close attention' to developments in theEvergrande crisis. 'Our view is that the [Chinese] government has the resources and the ability to ring-fence the problem, whichmeans that while we will see a shakeup happening in the real estate sector, that it will be contained and will not spillover more broadly' to China's economy, Gopinath told CBS news.The IMF expects global GDP to rise 5.9 percent this year against six percent in July. Beyond the real estate crisis, a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy had been anticipated by manyeconomists as the Chinese government, which is anxious to reduce debt, slows down investments by localauthorities and tightens conditions for bank loans.[1] appeared first on Digital Journal[2].

Less fuel-intensive regional flights accounted for most of the activity.Refiners lifted utilization rates to meet higher summer demand for transport fuels, boosting jet output to 2.4 milliontons. Imports reached 2.3 million tons as cargoes from the Middle East and Asia landed at European ports. SmallerEuropean countries accounted for most of the stockdraw in August which brought tank levels down to 10 milliontons.

Nov 2021;"United States : Brown Promotes Next Generation Jet Fuel, Supports";"Today, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) hosted a news conference call to discuss his Sustainable Skies Act, whichwould provide a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).Browns legislation aims to support the growth of the SAF industry in Ohio and capture more of the jet fuel market,as airlines work to cut aviations carbon emissions in half, by offering a tax credit for sustainable-aviation fuel usedin place of traditional jet fuel. Fuel would qualify if it creates at least 50 percent fewer emissions than traditionalairplane fuel.The aerospace industry already employs tens of thousands of Ohioans. With this tax credit, we can helpsustainable fuel production get off the ground by making it more cost-effective for airlines, and allow the industry togrow and scale up production and research, said Brown. When we commit to increasing sustainable fuelproduction, were both reducing emissions and jumpstarting a new, homegrown industry.Ohio, the birthplace of aviation, is well positioned to be a leader in the use and production of these new fuels withcompanies like GE Aviation supporting SAF development, and researchers at the University of Dayton, the AirForce Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson, and NASA Glenn working on low-carbon fuels.On the call, Brown spoke with Chris Lorence, chief engineer of jet engine maker GE Aviation which isheadquartered in Evendale, Ohio.Sustainable Aviation Fuel is vital to help the aviation industry meet its shared commitment to achieve net zerocarbon emissions from commercial flight by 2050, said Lorence. This requires increasing supply of SAF andintroducing incentives that encourage the aviation industry to speed up SAF adoption. This tax credit supports thesegoals and will lead toward a more sustainable future of flight.In 2018, the sustainable aviation fuel industry created about 2 million gallons of fuel. The goal with this legislation isto grow that number to 3 billion gallons by 2030. Air travel accounts for as much as 2.5 percent of global carbonemissions, 12 percent of U.S. transportation emissions and demand for air travel is expected to double over thenext 20 years.The legislation is supported by Airlines for America, American Line Pilot Association, Boeing, the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, GE Aviation, NetJets and United Airlines among others."
Nov 2021;"Near-term jet demand outlook blurs as aviation recovery hits fresh";" LONDON (ICIS)--European spot jet kerosene prices have been on a downward spiral,amid slowing buying appetite and waning market fundamentals. This is because demandin the aviation industry is uncertain following the resurgence in COVID-19 cases acrossthe region. Fears of a potential return of travel restrictions amid renewed lockdowns, besidesslowing passenger traffic compared to summer months has dented the near-term jet fuel demandoutlook. The market woes have been further worsened by lowering Rhine water levels, which arerestricting barge movements while pushing freight costs higher. Rhine water levels had been on a descent, before rising slightly to 93cm on 18 November.However, they are forecast to drop further to 73cms by 22 November, according to Elwis, aconsultancy focused on Germany's waterways. This could hamper the swift outflow of barges. Low water levels mean that barges can only partially load due to low water levels,meaning that what could normally be transported in one barge with typical water levelsmay need two or more barges, therefore increasing costs. This has pushed barge differentials higher, denting buying interest. With the overallmarket structure in backwardation, storage economics are dampened. Market views varied on the upswing in differentials, with the rise in bargedifferentials largely led by high freight costs, while cargo differentials suffer limited buyinginterest, pushing them below, or to the late, $20s/tonne. Consequently, jet spot outright values, on a weekly average basis, have been on adownward trajectory since the end of October. The market on close values for jet barges on a free on board (FOB) Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) basis dropped to $721/tonne, while jet cargoes CIF (cost,insurance & freight) NWE (northwest Europe) reached $716.50/tonne on Thursday 18November - down by over 4% since the end of October. headwinds Volatility in ICE Brent crude futures, along with waning market sentiment,has pulled the jet fuel prompt-month crack spread down to $9.80-10/bbl this week, from$12/bbl last week, substantiating the waning fundamentals. According to Eurocontrol, regional traffic has been stable at 79% of 2019 levels over thefirst 10 days of November. Airline operators say they continue to operate at 75% of 2019 levels, even thoughinternational flights remain a long way from that point. The return of lockdowns, as seen in Austria and the Netherlands, could dent passengerconfidence, while lowering jet fuel consumption rates. On the upside, steady gasoil demand in winter months and a lack of availability owing toreduced refinery throughputs are likely to lend some support. As of now any major rebound in aviation fuel consumption rates remains distant, withuncertainty around demand and recurring coronavirus waves to keep the market outlookgloomy."
Nov 2021;"Global Demand Trends: Peak Levels During Travel Season";"Global jet fuel demand in key markets reached its 2021 peak as it approached 2.7 million b/d in August. The UKand Canada showed the highest percentage gains among industrialized countries. Consumption in the big USmarket nearly crossed the 1.6 million b/d mark with more international flights. Europe posted an average gain of16% versus July with most travelers staying within the region. Lockdowns trimmed jet usage in Australia/NewZealand to 63,000 b/d. The picture was mixed among key developing countries. Demand in Mexico and Brazilreached a plateau in August after climbing steadily this year. A drop in South Korea reflected ongoing travelrestrictions throughout Asia. India's jet usage rebounded as the government eased capacity limits for domesticairlines. Usage of kerosene started its annual pre-winter climb.

Nov 2021;"Jet Demand Uncertainty Remains";"The US jet market may be gearing up for a bumper Thanksgiving holiday weekend but Europe could be headingback into lockdown with devastating consequences for regional airline fuel buying. Oil prices have been caughtbetween powerful crosswinds that have left them bouncing above $80 per barrel in recent weeks. Persistent Covid-19 cases and concerns over inflation present major risks to the downside. Yet near-term fundamentals remainsupportive as the Covid-19 demand recovery continues to outstrip supply.Oil prices fell on plans for a coordinated effort by the worldâ€™s two largest oil consumers, the US and China, totap into their strategic reserves. After an unsuccessful attempt to get Opec-plus to ramp up production, Washingtonis now looking to tap inventories in order to take fuel prices down a notch. China is currently estimated to hold 270million barrels of oil in its government-managed strategic reserve and just below 800 million bbl in commercialinventories. The US holds just over 600 million bbl of oil in the federal government's SPR. International benchmarkBrent ended the week down $1.63/bbl at $81.24/bbl, while US price-pin West Texas Intermediate shed a heftier$2.58/bbl to end the week at $79.01/bbl. Many European countries are reintroducing Covid-19 restrictions as afourth wave of infections takes hold. Most of the current restrictions only affect unvaccinated citizens but tougherrules are expected. Austria has just announced a 20-day national lockdown from Monday while the head ofGermanyâ€™s disease control agency Friday called for drastic action after a record number of new infections for aninth day. Growing Covid-19 fears are already dampening demand for air travel. Eurocontrolâ€™s seven-dayaverage flight tracker showed traffic almost 23% below 2019 levels by Nov. 18, down from a less than 20% deficiton Nov. 10. Into-wing fuelers suggest airline fuel purchases are running barely 60% of pre-pandemic levels despitethe restart of long-haul flights to the US. Europeâ€™s spot jet cargo market is also heading into lockdown withscant bids from regional heavyweights BP and Royal Dutch Shell drawing no offers by Thursdayâ€™s window andno trades seen. Chinaâ€™s Unipec had been offering volume into Rotterdam earlier in the week at some $4-$7 perton above bidding interest at the time. The standoff comes as bellwether jet fuel tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) fell to their lowest level since May 2020. ARA jet tanks stood at 835,000 tons on Nov. 18, accordingto Insights Global, having peaked above 1.2 million tons last November. Reopening of the US to internationaltravelers has encouraged refiners to ramp up jet fuel yields to 8.7% of refined product output. Thatâ€™s close topre-pandemic levels, albeit with lower overall capacity due to 1.5 million barrels per day lost from plant closuresover the past 20 months. Downstream utilization rates continue to climb as refiners come back from maintenanceturnarounds, reaching 87.9% in the week ended Nov. 12. Higher jet demand has lifted jet fuel margins. So far inNovember the jet crack versus a barrel of sour crude on the Gulf Coast has averaged $16.45/bbl, versus just $4.50this time last year. US jet markets weakened even though jet fundamentals continue to improve. A 6Â¢ per gallondrop in diesel futures on the week pushed outright quotes down to the $2.20-$2.30 range. Stronger spreads aremaking New York Harbor barrels the most expensive in the country. But limited space on the Colonial pipeline iskeeping product flows from the Gulf Coast in check, even though wider price differentials versus New York haveimproved the economics for shippers. Imports continue to flow in at high rates of 190,000 b/d to take advantage ofstronger values in US markets. Jet fuel demand is poised for a holiday liftoff after sales dipped to 1.38 million b/din mid-November from their 1.5 million b/d average over the last four weeks. The Asian jet market weakenedconsiderably despite rising arbitrage jet flows and growing air traffic in South Asia. The benchmark Singapore spotprice differential plunged by 34Â¢/bbl to a premium of 1Â¢/bbl to Singapore quotes on Nov. 18, its lowest level in amonth. The arrival of the newly built LR2 tanker Jaarli in Rotterdam has been delayed to Dec. 5 from an earlier Nov.14 date, according to data intelligence company Kpler. The Vitol-chartered tanker had loaded around 96,000 tons ofjet from South Korea on Oct. 12 and is heading north to Europe after rounding the Cape of Good Hope, SouthAfrica, Kpler added. Arbitrage flows of jet from East of Suez to west of the canal rose by 52,000 tons to 293,000tons in the week starting Nov. 15, Kpler noted. Of those volumes, 253,000 tons loaded from Kuwait and 40,000 tonscame from Korea, with the cargoes expected to arrive from Dec. 1-9 in Europe and the US West Coast, Hawaii orAlaska. A 10% jump in South Asia's scheduled airline capacity for the week of Nov. 15 lifted prompt jet demand,according to aviation data analysis firm OAG.

Nov 2021;"European jet fuel under pressure as aviation demand stays quiet";" LONDON (ICIS)--European jet kerosene spot values have continued their downwardspiral as sentiments have been dampened by rising coronavirus cases in the region andgreater volatility in upstream crude oil futures. Renewed lockdowns imposed by many major European economies, including Austria,Germany and the Netherlands, have raised concerns this could derail a recovery inaviation demand, which is nowhere close to pre-pandemic levels. Any upside derived from the lifting of US travel restrictions and Christmas holidayseason travels has been offset by the resurgence in coronavirus cases deterringpassenger confidence. Regional demand has been indicated stable-to-low, amid limited trading in thephysical spot space, as most airlines remain sufficiently stocked. Lacklustre buying canalso be partly attributed to limited business ahead of Thanksgiving, as well as typicallylower demand during this time of year. Adding to these woes are fluctuating upstream ICE Brent crude future values, which fellbelow $80/bbl mark late last week, before rebounding again close to $82/bbl mark earlierthis week. Even though jet kerosene spot values have mirrored volatility in crude, spot values onCIF (cost, insurance & freight) NWE (northwest Europe) prices fell 7% from mid-Octoberhighs to $724.75/tonne on Wednesday 25 November. CIF NWE spot values were indeed over $90/tonne down at $687/tonne towards the closeof last week, when compared to year-to-date highs of $779.25/tonne on Friday 15 October- substantiating weakness in the market. Meanwhile, the prompt-month crack spread against rolling Brent has been assessed at$8.70/bbl, holding a slight contango for Q1 2022 at $10.50/bbl and subsequently for Q2 2022at $11.50/bbl. Buying for barges has been pretty dull for the last couple of weeks, as vesselscan only be partially loaded because of low water levels at the , pushing logistics costs higher. That had serious financial implications for petrochemicals companies, who took a hit inthe hundreds of millions of euros due to higher logistical costs caused by the low waterlevels. Meanwhile, a backwardation in both jet fuel and gasoil markets has kept storage buyingminimal, with year-end destocking to exert downward pressure on differentials. Fundamentals are typically weaker this time of the year as fewer flights operate comparedwith summer months. Any uptick in demand anticipated post the resumption of flights onthe transatlantic route is subdued by renewed lockdowns across many European nations. While some impact of reduced refinery throughputs has been realised keeping themarket balanced, nearly one million metric tonnes is expected to arrive from East of Suezinto the United Kingdom/Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) this month, which couldoffset any upside. In December, demand typically picks up due to the holiday season across Europe.However, amid the rising infections and renewed lockdowns, the near-term outlookappears gloomy."
Nov 2021;"Chinese airlines reinstate fuel surcharge, as oil prices go up";"A number of Chinese airlines including Air China, Ruili Airlines and Lucky Air will reinstate a fuel surcharge fordomestic flights, beginning November 5, the Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) was quoted as saying in a CCTVreport on Thursday.This is the first time since the fuel surcharge was removed in January 2019, after a fall in the market rate for jetfuel.According to the CAAC, adult passengers will be charged a fuel surcharge of 10 yuan ($1.56) per person for flightsshorter than 800 kilometers, and 20 yuan per passenger for flights longer than 800 kilometers.For instance, the flight distance from Beijing Capital International Airport to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airporttotals 1,178 kilometers, meaning a one-way ticket will be charged an extra 20-yuan fuel surcharge.With the recent rise in international crude prices, domestic jet fuel price will likely surpass 5,000 yuan per ton inNovember, the threshold of the fuel surcharge for domestic flights, leading to the resumption of the surcharge,experts said."
Nov 2021;"'Global Economic Outlook is Further Uncertain Now'";"MOODY'S TO REVISE OUTLOOK IF VIRUS TURNS VIRULENTThe Omicron variant of Covid-19 has added a measure of uncertainty to the outlook for the global economy,Moody's Analytics said in a report. It said if the variant turns out to be more contagious, virulent and disruptive tothe economy, the agency would need to revise its outlook for the economy.“Omicron reminds us that the global economic recovery remains tethered to the pandemic,"" the report, 'Much toLearn About Omicron — Fast', authored by Steve Cochrane, chief APAC economist at Moody's Analytics, said. Thereport, however, added that it is too early to quantify the risk to economic recovery as a lot depends on the speedof transmission of the new variant, its virulence, associated rates of hospitalisation and death, besides effectivenessof vaccines and antiviral medications.“It will be at least two more weeks before more will be known, as scientists around the world build a betterunderstanding of the new variant and as the severity of infections becomes clearer,"" the agency said in the reporton Sunday.It noted that the Omicron variant illustrates the existing risk to the global economy from regions or individualcountries that had low vaccination rates. This includes all of sub-Saharan Africa, where rates remain below 50%,and 60 countries globally with rates below 20%."
Dec 2021;"Global jet fuel demand under pressure";" Global jet fuel markets stayed under pressure on Tuesday as morecountries expanded border restrictions to keep the new Omicron coronavirus variant at bay, prompting travellers toreconsider their plans.Jet fuel demand, the biggest laggard in the oil complex, had been forecast to post the strongest growth of 550 000barrels per day to 5.9 million bpd in fourth quarter, according to the International Energy Agency in its Nov. 16report.But now Omicron pose the greatest risk to jet fuel consumption. Hong Kong expanded a ban on entry for non-residents from several countries, the latest to expand travel curbs after Israel and Japan have already announcedborder closures to all foreign travellers.Britain and Australia have tightened rules for all arrivals in response to the new variant while hundreds andthousands of would-be travellers are now considering to cancel or delay their trips in response to renewedrestrictions.The real risk from the new variant is the reimposition of more widespread flight restrictions during the winter andagain reducing current global jet fuel demand of some 6 million barrels per day significantly,"" energy consultancyFGE said in a note.Asian refining margins for jet fuel slumped to their lowest in more that two months on Monday at US$6.92 a barrel,while the front-month time spread for the aviation fuel in Singapore flipped to a contango for the first time sinceend-September. -Nampa/Reuters"
Dec 2021;"Tight U.S. Oil Inventories Prop Up Oil Prices";"U.S. oil demand and inventories have offered support to oil prices in recent months and, volatility excluded, havecontinued to do so, with stocks below the five-year average for this time of the year.While oil prices have swung in recent weeks between as high as $85 in late October to below $70 in late Novemberamid fears of Omicron denting demand and a looming oversupply, lower-than-usual American stockpiles have beenone constantly bullish theme for oil, especially the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude.Coupled with robust U.S. gasoline demand and a record high overall petroleum demand, tight American inventorieshave propped up oil prices, or at least prevented them from falling too much despite the market fears of aslowdown in global oil demand recovery and the return to oversupply in coming weeks.Earlier this week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that the surge in COVID cases was set to temporarilyslow the recovery in global oil demand, but the impact of the Omicron variant would likely be more muted thanprevious waves and would not upend the current demand recovery.""New containment measures put in place to halt the spread of the virus are likely to have a more muted impact onthe economy versus previous Covid waves, not least because of widespread vaccination campaigns. As a result,we expect demand for road transport fuels and petrochemical feedstocks to continue to post healthy growth,"" IEAsaid in its latest Oil Market Report for December.Jet fuel demand is the biggest victim of the Omicron scare as international travel was again restricted with tougherentry requirements in many countries, including for fully vaccinated travelers.Yet, demand for other fuels holds globally. This is especially true for the United States, where gasolineconsumption is robust despite high prices and where petroleum inventories are lower than usual for this time of theyear.Even with the expected product and crude builds in the coming months, inventory increases will be starting frommuch lower levels than in previous years, preventing a massive oversupply and limiting the downward pressure onoil prices, Reuters columnist John Kemp notes.For last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a crude inventory draw of 4.6 million barrels forthe week to December 10. At 428.3 million barrels, crude oil inventories remain 7% below the five-year average forthis time of the year. Last week's draw compares with a modest 200,000-barrel decline in crude inventories for theprevious week.Gasoline inventories fell by 700,000 barrels for the week to December 10, which compared with a build of 3.9million barrels for the previous week. Total gasoline inventories are now about 6% below the five-year average forthis time of year. In middle distillates, the EIA estimated an inventory decline of 2.9 million barrels for the week toDecember 10, versus an increase of 2.7 million barrels for the previous week. Distillate fuel inventories are about9% below the seasonal five-year average.Moreover, implied gasoline demand jumped to 9.47 million bpd last week from 8.96 million bpd in the prior week.In addition, total implied petroleum consumption in the United States rose to a record 23.191 million bpd for theweek ending December 10. The previous record was set during the week ending August 27 of this year, whichreached fresh highs of 22.820 million bpd.The fast spread of the Omicron COVID variant currently clouds the global oil demand outlook, with high uncertaintyand fears of a glut in early 2022, but still robust U.S. petroleum demand, falling U.S. gasoline prices, and crude andproduct inventories below seasonal norms could prop up oil prices into 2022.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comCOMTEX_399282978/2559/2021-12-20T06:12:08"

Consumption averaged more than 50% above 2020 rates for the month at some 3.7 milliontons. On the supply side, production dipped to 2.1 million tons as refineries reduced crude throughput.

Some of that volume was diverted across the Atlantic to theUS, where damage from Hurricane Ida had shut down Gulf Coast refineries in late August. Rebalancing of theEuropean jet fuel market pushed regional inventories down to 9.3 million tons at end-September. Higher airlineliftings through the summer months depleted tank levels in the UK, Spain and Italy by a wide margin. Bycomparison France and Germany still had relatively ample stocks.

Dec 2021;"Downsizing of North American Refining May Subside";"Changes in North Americaâ€™s refining landscape are reshaping supply dynamics and the regional jet fuelmarket as it rebuilds from the pandemic. Rationalization of downstream capacity may be coming to an end for thetime being. North America had surplus throughput capacity well before Covid-19 and acceleration of the energytransition upended refining economics. Both factors hastened plant closures, conversions, and attempted sales.With US refining capacity now south of 18 million barrels per day â€ more than 800,000 b/d below pre-pandemiclevels â€ some experts say the industry is balanced and that rationalization can pause. To be sure, downstreamplayers are still scrutinizing their assets. But the weakest members of the refinery herd have largely been culled,and conversions to produce renewable fuels may become more difficult going forward. Thatâ€™s because existingand planned facilities could lead to a supply crunch of feedstocks such as soybean oil and tallow. This logistics anddistribution issue on the feedstock side could boost operating costs. Political factors also come into play:Renewable diesel and renewable jet fuel remain uneconomical without incentives and credits under the RenewableFuels Standard and other low-carbon regulations. A Republican takeover of the US legislature after midtermelections next November could result in policy changes that undermine the economics of renewable fuels. MarketOpportunity Capacity may even grow slightly in the near term due to ongoing additions and the possibility thatdormant facilities could come back to life. Currently low prices for refineries may provide an opportunity foracquisitions, especially for market players with a more conservative outlook on the pace of the energy transition. Atleast one refinery expansion seems set to continue. Exxon Mobilâ€™s Beaumont, Texas, plant will add some250,000 b/d of capacity geared toward processing light crude from nearby shale plays, with start-up scheduled for2023. In addition, the proposed revival of the St. Croix refinery, formerly known as Hovensa, made further headwaythis week. A bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the 200,000 b/d plant for $62 million to West Indies Petroleumand Port Hamilton Refining. The former owner of the troubled refinery â€ Limetree Bay â€ shut the plant downearlier this year after investing billions of dollars. On the US Gulf Coast, Royal Dutch Shell recently turned down abid for its Convent, Louisiana, refinery and proceeded to idle the facility. Convent could be sold to the right buyerand return to service, although that possibility becomes more difficult the longer it remains off line. Facilities alongNorth Americaâ€™s eastern seaboard still face troubles, with serious implications for regional jet fuel supply.Those US and Canadian Atlantic areas have borne the brunt of downstream rationalization, alongside California.Several years ago the region lost the Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, and Yorktown, Virginia, plants. In 2019 thePhiladelphia Energy Solutions refinery was scrapped following an explosion. PBF Energy has downsized itsregional footprint. And most recently, Cresta Fund Management acquired the Come-by-Chance refinery inNewfoundland, Canada, which it plans to convert to a plant producing sustainable aviation fuel and renewablediesel. Another two plants face near-term challenges. John Auers of consultancy Turner, Mason and Co. said thatthe outlook is particularly difficult for Shellâ€™s 85,000 b/d Sarnia, Ontario, refinery. Long-standing regional factorssuch as constrained access to cheap feedstock and demand stagnation have undermined its profitability.Meanwhile, Delta Air Linesâ€™ 185,000 b/d Monroe refinery in Pennsylvania â€ purchased in 2012 as an in-housesupplier of jet fuel â€ suffered from a pandemic-induced nosedive in jet demand. Engineers had tweaked the plantto maximize jet yields to as much as 30% of its capacity. But with US jet fuel usage still in recovery mode, jetmargins are lagging behind ground transportation fuels. After recording modest profits during some periods overthe last decade, the refinery has become a liability after Covid-19 disrupted air travel .Frans Koster"
Dec 2021;"Pandemic Surge Clouds Jet Demand Outlook";"The aviation sector had high hopes for continued recovery in 2022 following two challenging years battling theCovid-19 pandemic. But headwinds from Omicron and other potential variants may prevent global jet fuel marketsfrom reaching 2019 proportions until at least 2024. By then sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and more efficientaircraft may start chipping away at conventional jet fuel growth. Before Omicron, economists at the International AirTransport Association (IATA) had expressed cautious optimism for 2022. The organization saw domestic marketsreaching 93% of pre-crisis levels, although international markets would still only recover to 44% next year.Projections ranged from a 75% traffic recovery in Europe, to 65% for the North Atlantic and just 11% in Asia.Energy Intelligence data show global jet fuel demand climbing to 6.2 million barrels per day in 2022, 20% below itspeak in 2019. Jet demand grows only to 6.9 million b/d in 2023, according to Energy Intelligence estimates.Uncertainties about jet fuel demand could upend global oil demand forecasts for years to come. The boombetween 2009-19 that saw global air traffic grow an average of 4% and increase fuel demand 2% annually nowseems like an anomaly. The pandemic not only wiped out two years of growth but also fractured connectivity. Travelrestrictions have distorted air traffic patterns, with three distinct segments growing at different rates. Domesticmarkets are performing the strongest but regional and long-haul services face significant barriers. Domesticmarkets were off 20% from 2019 levels, according to the latest IATA passenger data, while international marketswere down 80%. IATAâ€™s 20-year forecast projects annual passenger traffic growth rates slowing to between1.5%-3.8% globally through 2040. Travel barriers have caused wide variations in regional jet demand trends. TheUS is pacing the global rebound as its large domestic market helps restore fuel demand to 1.4 million b/d this year.More international flights should boost consumption to 1.6 million b/d next year and pre-pandemic levels couldreturn in 2023. A matrix of border restrictions clouds the European outlook, which shows jet usage staying wellbelow 2019 rates through 2023. Outside the OECD, Asia-Pacific is lagging behind the rest of the world withinternational traffic still 95% below 2019 levels through October, according to IATA data. Asia could catch up quicklyif connectivity is restored, with demand from China and India pushing Asian fuel usage back above 2 million b/d by2023. The different industry segments that drive jet demand are seeing varying rates of recovery. Burgeoning worldtrade flows have made air cargo the strongest-performing subsector. Leisure travel is leading the rebound on thepassenger side. Business travel still trails by a wide margin. Freight volumes now exceed 2019 levels by 9%. ACovid-19 resurgence threatens to further delay conference travel. The World Economic Forum was among the firstto postpone its annual January meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Lower load factors, averaging 61% versus 78% in2019, are crimping airline revenue. Airlines also face huge operational challenges. Fuel prices are at seven-yearhighs. Carriers are grappling with supply chain constraints and shortages of experienced staff. Costs from low-carbon regulations are rising. IATA calculations show that the European Unionâ€™s Fit for 55 package to reduceemissions could add â¬39 billion to annual airline expenses by 2035 â€ nearly twice the â¬22 billion industry-wideprofit in 2019. Meeting the net-zero target requires massive outlays for SAF purchases and carbon offsets.Meantime, carbon prices are setting price records on a weekly basis and currently stand above â¬90 per ton. BothAirbus and Boeing have been forced to delay deliveries of new aircraft with better fuel efficiency due to shortagesof components.

Dec 2021;"OUTLOOK '22: Jet fuel demand to grow slowly but steadily on modest air";" LONDON (ICIS)--The outlook for aviation fuel demand-growth recovery is cautiouslyoptimistic for 2022 as airline capacity is expected to grow later in the coming year, afterstarting the journey in 2021 amid recurring COVID-19 waves. A resurgence in European jet fuel demand this year has been hit particularly hard bycontinued international travel restrictions - limiting long-haul flying, which remain crucial forregional aviation business growth, capping aviation fuel consumption. That said, domestic travel demand stayed strong as consumer confidence improved afterlockdowns were eased earlier this year, supporting demand-side fundamentals, whilecautious refinery throughputs hindered length from returning to the market. Peak buying recorded during the summer holiday period, especially in September, whendomestic air travel demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometres or RPKs) neared49% of September 2019 levels, bolstering jet consumption rates and refinery margins.BEARISH FACTORSThat said, the lack of jet fuel demand still weighs on the overallrefining complex, limiting crude run growth, particularly in Europe, said Michael Connolly,principal consultant at ICIS. ""The lack of demand recovery to traditional levels and impending competition from newexport-orientated refining capacity in the Middle East mounts further downwards pressure,""Connolly argues. These supply-side trends could prove detrimental should demand fail to improve amidrecurring waves and growing travel restrictions, with only the pace of the vaccine roll-outand government policies determining the demand growth, particularly for internationaltravel. After recording the worst performance on record in 2020, the aviation demand recoveryhas been slow yet steady in 2021, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA)predicting that global RPKs will reach 40% of pre-crisis levels.POSITIVE ON THE HOME FRONT Improved confidence and consumers' accumulatedsavings following prolonged lockdowns last year have supported domestic travel recovery acrossall regions. travel rebound IATA forecasts global RPKs will improve by 51% in 2022, reaching 61% of pre-crisislevels, although growth will be largely led by air cargo volumes, which have recoveredabove 2019 levels and are expected to stay strong throughout next year. That optimism is also backed by Cirium, a sister service of ICIS that provides aviationand travel data and analytics, which suggests that the recovery will continue. Cirium forecasts that the growth will be largely led by an increase in long-haul flightsand business travel, which contributes to the highest proportion of aviation revenue. Approaching monthly recovery scenarios on a regional basis, Cirium is predicting a globalrecovery to 2019 demand levels (on a month-on-month basis) by August 2023, withannualised volume projected to exceed 2019 in 2024, according to Rob Morris, head ofconsultancy at Cirium. Looking at 2022 specifically, the graph below shows monthly RPK volume projections(relative to the same month in 2019), basis key taking into account different factorspertaining to a rebound in international traffic, passenger fleet levels, business travel,besides air cargo performance. These recovery trends have supported jet fuel demand projections from the InternationalEnergy Agency (IEA) in its latest Oil Market Report, suggesting that the demand is forecastto rise by 550,000 bbl/day in the fourth quarter of 2021 and by 180,000 bbl/day in the firstquarter of 2022, when it is expected to reach 6.1m bbl/day. Projecting strong growth from a low base, partly tempered by new waves of coronaviruscases affecting travel, the IEA forecasts that jet kerosene demand in 2021 will rise by600,000 bbl/day to 5.2m bbl/day and in 2022 will jump to 1.2m bbl/day to 6.4m bbl/day,roughly 20% below pre-COVID levels. North America will be at the forefront of the global aviation recovery, closely followed byEurope, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. IATA predicts that in 2022, North American jet kerosene demand will average 8% belowpre-COVID levels, as aviation benefits from a strong domestic market, while demand inLatin America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East will be roughly 27% below 2019 levelsduring the same period. Asia-Pacific demand will be close to 20% below 2019 levels, inline with the global average. While the domestic growth pending improved vaccination rates and easing of travelrestrictions will lead the way to recovery, a rebound in long-haul flights after internationalborders are reopened will be likely to boost the aviation industry - a key jet fuel consumingmarket - supporting the more bullish outlook for 2022.

Dec 2021;"Aviation fuel demand to tumble as new variant emerges, pressurising spot";" LONDON (ICIS)--Downward pressure on European jet kerosene spot values continues tomount, following the emergence of the new Omicron variant of COVID-19. This has softened upstream crude values and dented demand in a market alreadystruggling to gain any buying interest. To curb the spread of the heavily mutated variant, many nations across the world haveintroduced fresh travel bans and increased travel restrictions, which could provedetrimental for the global aviation business. Many countries have banned flights from South Africa and neighbouring countries, whereinfections have risen steeply, not only denting aviation demand but also shaking passengerconfidence. Rising concerns over the potential wild spread of the new variant have pulled upstreamcrude futures down to the $72/bbl mark, significantly lower than the end of October year-to-date highs of $86/bbl. Despite weakening Brent crude futures, the prompt-month crack spread failed to registera significant rebound, staying at $9/bbl, albeit marginally up from $8.70/bbl at the sametime last week. In fact, Europe jet kerosene spot values have been on a downward spiralsince early November, with prices on a CIF (cost, insurance & freight) NWE (northwestEurope) basis falling by 12% week-on-week to $630.25-631.25/tonne on Tuesday 30November, compared with the same time last week. Trading remains lacklustre in the open market despite a plethora of bids and offers,suggesting little demand for aviation fuel. Meanwhile, a backwardation in both the jet fuel and gasoil markets has kept storagebuying minimal, with sellers mainly obliging contracts amid limited spot buying. A mixed bag of opinions, however, ruled the market this week as some traders statedthat any impact of the renewed travel restrictions is yet to be realised. At the same time,slowing aviation demand during the winter holiday season continues to dampen sentiments. values Even though air traffic has been stable over the first 24 days of November, at 78% of2019 levels, according to Eurocontrol, it has slowly decreased since early September, orrather the peak summer holiday season. Keeping the market balanced, however, are reduced refinery throughputs, owing to asqueeze on margins, which is largely led by a lack of demand discounting any impact oflowering crude oil values. In terms of inflows, volumes into Europe have been low as regional demand struggles tosee the light of day, while stock levels in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA), havedropped for the fourth consecutive week. They fell by 3% for the week ending 25November, according to PJK International data. The buy-side scenario is traditionally sluggish during this time of the year withsome destocking traditionally, however, with refiners producing hand-to-mouth and fearinga lack of sustainable demand, the trend is unlikely to be seen this year. That said, with slowing aviation growth approaching the year end, and the ongoingsuspension of flights amid heightened concerns over the Omicron variant, buying appetite foraviation fuel is likely to be in the doldrums. values"
Dec 2021;"Oil: Pandemic Panic Attack";"The latest events of the pandemic bring a lot of uncertainty regarding the short-term outlook for oil.The latest twists of the pandemic, the return of travel restrictions and the general rebound in uncertainty pressuredfinancial markets and caused a sharp drop in oil prices on Friday.Restrictions on international air travel have only a marginal impact on the oil market. In addition to the many openquestions regarding the new variant of the virus, the intensity of economic restrictions as well as the reaction of oilnations will significantly influence the impact on oil markets and the reaction of oil prices. We are attentive to newdevelopments in the sector.The fear factor took over financial markets on Friday. The rapidly evolving news flow toward the end of last weekfueled concerns about the intensification of another pandemic wave, tightening mobility restrictions and a halt ineconomic activity. Oil prices fell more than 10%.Fundamentally, the restrictions on international air travel announced and enacted cannot explain such a steep drop.Air travel accounts for about 5% to 7% of global oil demand, with domestic and interregional connections in NorthAmerica, Europe and Asia accounting for the bulk of jet fuel use. Capital market factors appear to have added tothe sell-off, with low trading activity due to a US holiday and possible hedging of long positions intensifying pricemovements.The latest events of the pandemic bring a lot of uncertainty regarding the short-term outlook. The oil market is in atransitional phase in which production growth outpaces demand growth and storage moves from adjustment toeasing.The fundamental impact of known air travel restrictions is limited and only broader restrictions would significantlyaccelerate this transition.That said, oil nations could pause in gradual easing of production restrictions in the face of the current increase inuncertainty, which would slow down this transition. The expectation of a tighter oil policy partially explains thecurrent recovery in the price of oil.Given these new uncertainties, we are attentive to the evolution of the pandemic and its impact on thefundamentals of the oil market."
Dec 2021;"China's Product Exports Unlikely to Revisit Highs";"China exported 2.35 million tons of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel in November, lifting its exports of the three productsto 38.45 million tons for January-November of this year. But refiners will have their exports capped at low levels inDecember, with China's full-year 2021 exports of transportation fuels likely to fall to their lowest levels since 2017,Energy Intelligence estimates. Furthermore, China's exports of refined products may never return to their previoushighs as refiners come under pressure to cap their carbon emissions. China's exports of diesel fell by almost 69%from the same month of last year to 600,000 tons in November, customs data show.Tight diesel supplies in China during October had prompted state-controlled refiners to concentrate on deliveringdiesel to the domestic market. In contrast, jet fuel exports doubled from a year ago to 940,000 tons in Novemberas Covid-19 outbreaks in China persisted, further curtailing domestic air travel. Sources had estimated last monththat a third round of export quotas issued in November would allow Chinese refiners â€ state-owned companiesand privately owned Zhejiang Petrochemicals â€ to export a total of 37.61 million to 38.58 million tons of gasoline,diesel and jet this year. The November data now indicate that the total quotas allocated for this year will allowexports at the upper end of that range. Even if that is the case, companies would be limited to exporting just130,000 tons this month, which will likely make for tight conditions in the Asia-Pacific products market. This in turnmeans that China's full-year transportation fuel exports for 2021 would dip below the 40.83 million tons exported in2017. A return to China's 2019 record exports of 55.36 million tons of gasoline, jet and gasoil seems highly unlikely.Chinese observers have told Energy Intelligence that Beijing is likely to hold products export quotas more or lesssteady in 2022 as it seeks to cap carbon emissions by discouraging overproduction at home. The country's risingrefining overcapacity prompted the government to introduce a system of export quotas in the last decade. ButBeijing's pledge to halt the steady increase in its carbon emissions by 2030 and to become carbon-neutral by 2060has prompted efforts to cap exports of refined products to discourage companies from running their plants flat out.Beijing has also set a ceiling of 20 million barrels per day for its refining capacity by 2025 and has been seeking toclose older and less efficient plants. ""The priority is for self-sufficiency. It will likely continue next year, but will not beas drastic as this year,"" Energy Aspects China specialist Yuntao Liu told Energy Intelligence. In addition, theemergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 may bring the nascent recovery in oil demand in Southeast Asia to ahalt, an analyst with a Chinese consultancy told Energy Intelligence. That would discourage exporters fromrequesting high quotas, at least in the first round for 2022, which is expected to be released before the end of thismonth. ""Products exports will slightly decline. Emission caps are one of the reasons,"" the analyst said. ""Demandfrom Southeast Asia seems quite fragile. There is no incentive for NOCs [national oil companies] to boost their oilproducts exports,"" the source added.

Dec 2021;"Demand: Omicron Bump Hinders Jet Fuel But GDP Growth Key Driver";"The final quarter of 2021 marks a steady demand crescendo, from 100.5 million barrels per day in October to justshy of 101 million b/d in December, with November in between coming in at 100.6 million b/d, according topreliminary data. Global oil consumption in the fourth quarter is gaining 1.6 million b/d on the quarter, breakingthrough 100 million b/d for the first time since 2019. This steady recovery has been backed by a strong economicrebound, stemming initially from the US and China, with Europe following in steps. Oil demand is adding 5.5 millionb/d in 2021, and expanding 3.1 million b/d in 2022 â€ an upward revision of 200,000 b/d from last month for a total100.4 million b/d next year, which is 400,000 b/d less than 2019. Covid-19 is still lingering and while vaccinationrates will go up, emerging markets are lagging. Demand is seen growing 1.5 million b/d in 2023. The short-termdemand outlook remains uncertain . Fuel switching might again pick up with natural gas prices rising fast in Europe.Longer term, despite the energy transition and lower oil intensity of global GDP, oil growth is still positivelycorrelated to economic growth, which is expected to hover around 4.5% in 2022. The new Omicron variant hasalready prompted a fair bout of concern about its ability to spread fast.Government and personal restrictions on travel and trade impact global oil demand, which is felt well into the firstquarter of 2022, primarily in the jet fuel market. Energy Intelligence data show that global jet demand has beenstagnating around 5.7 million b/d since September 2021. OECD countries are likely to bear the brunt of the Omicroneffect on flight rescheduling and cancellations, with an expected 300,000 b/d drop in jet consumption in January.Several countries in Europe were already facing a resurgence in Covid-19 caseloads and had reinstated somecontainment measures before the Omicron discovery made the headlines. As a result, OECD Europe registered a215,000 b/d demand drop in November, despite a rebound of more than 1 million b/d year on year. Japan, SouthKorea, Australia and New Zealand, however, remained in full recovery pace after an earlier series of similarrestrictions, jointly posting 465,000 b/d of additional demand month on month in November. In all, OECD gained 3.8million b/d last month versus November 2020, more than twice the annual growth of non-OECD countries inNovember, at 1.7 million b/d. On a quarterly basis, non-OECD recovered 1.1 million b/d of demand in the fourthquarter of 2021, versus 446,000 b/d for the OECD group. China was again center stage and remained by far themain demand growth driver in November, adding 350,000 b/d in consumption. The recent Beijing crackdown on theconstruction and property sector (about one-third of GDP) may dampen future growth if development stalls. Itspotential impact would be felt by so-called â€œbottom-of-the-barrelâ€ products like bitumen, heavy oil and fuel oilthat are used at large scale by the construction industry, and also diesel for transportation.

Jan 2022;"Key jet fuel market metric surges as flight demand withstands Omicron";" January 19 -- The jet fuel market is soaring in Europe as global air traffic withstands the impact of the omicronvirus strain.One of the fuel's most important market metrics, its differential to diesel, on Friday surged to its highest sinceSeptember 2019 -- long before Covid-19 decimated the continent's aviation industry.""We're tight supply everywhere,"" said Mark Williams, an oil products markets and refining analyst at WoodMackenzie Ltd. For Europe, ""everyone was expecting demand to take a hit because of omicron. That hasn'temerged -- so jet demand has stayed pretty healthy.""While flights are still way down on 2019 levels, they're only slightly below where they were in November, accordingto data from FlightRadar24, which tracks commercial flights. That's in stark contrast to the plunge in global air trafficand jet fuel demand in the spring of 2020.The strong European prices aren't being reflected everywhere, however.Asian regrade, as the premium to diesel is known, is still below pre-pandemic levels. China is slashing flights tofight outbreaks and Hong Kong recently banned flights from eight countries, including the U.S. The measure is alsobelow its seasonal norm in the U.S.When jet fuel prices crashed in 2020, refiners responded by diverting production into other products. But yieldshave risen in recent months in the U.S., and in Europe were at 6% from June through October, up from a low of 4%during the worst of the pandemic, according to IHS Markit. Before Covid, European yields were about 9%.Globally, jet fuel demand is forecast to surge about 45% from late January to early July, according toBloombergNEF, with growth particularly strong in North America and Western Europe."
Jan 2022;"Economists Say Inflation Will Hurt Global Economy";"Persistently high inflation will harm the world economy this year, according to a new poll of economists.The poll, conducted by the Reuters News Agency, found that a majority of economists have trimmed their globalgrowth outlook for 2022 on worries of slowing demand and the risk that interest rates will rise faster than previouslyexpected.This represents a sea change from just three months ago, when most economists were siding with central bankersin their then view that a surge in inflation, driven in part by pandemic-related supply bottlenecks, would betransitory.In the latest quarterly survey of more than 500 economists taken throughout January, economists raised their 2022inflation forecasts for most of the 46 economies covered.At the same time, economists downgraded their global growth forecasts. After expanding 5.8% last year, the worldeconomy is expected to slow to 4.3% growth in 2022, down from 4.5% predicted in October, in part because ofhigher interest rates and costs of living.Global economic growth is seen slowing further to 3.6% and 3.2% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, according tothe poll of economists.Nearly 40% of those surveyed singled out inflation as the top risk to the global economy this year, with nearly 35%picking COVID-19 variants, and 22% worried about central banks moving too quickly on interest rates.The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled it would raise its benchmark federal funds rate from a recordlow of 0-0.25% in March after shuttering its bond purchase program.The Bank of England was the first major central bank to raise rates since the pandemic started and is expected toact again this year. The Bank of Canada is also seen hiking rates soon.In contrast, most economists expect the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to stay put on interest ratesat least until the end of next year (2023).The growth outlook for over 60% of the 46 economies covered in the poll was either downgraded or left unchangedfor 2022 and about 90% of respondents, 144 of 163, said there was a downside risk to their forecasts.COMTEX_401353219/2559/2022-01-28T09:42:33"

Jan 2022;"Jet Overtakes Diesel But Europe's Suppliers Struggle to Adjust";"Europeâ€™s leading jet fuel traders are warning that key overseas suppliers might not be able to respond toresurgent jet economics because of existing diesel commitments. A stream of newbuild very large crude carriers(VLCCs) is heading for the Mideast Gulf to load or at least top up with ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) for Europe inthe coming months, meaning crucial swing producers canâ€™t switch back to jet no matter how profitable. â€œIttakes time,â€ warns one London-based jet trader. â€œThose [Mideast refiners] who have committed to fillingVLCCs canâ€™t switch to making jet until they have [done so].â€ He explains: â€œTo make jet, you have to forgodiesel.â€ Europeâ€™s ULSD market is just as backwardated as jet, meaning the situation could change beforerefiners have a chance to adjust.â€œWith backwardation on both products, values will fly around,â€ the trader cautions. Refiners have focused ondiesel production for the best part of two years, rejigging units to make as little jet as possible throughout thepandemic. Before last weekâ€™s dramatic resurgence, jet had been trading at a discount to diesel in Europe sinceFebruary 2020. Jet fuel's regrade â€ its usual premium over diesel â€ hit a 27-month high of nearly $2 per barrellast week having collapsed to an all-time low of minus $12/bbl in April 2020, when aircraft were completelygrounded and refiners were forced to pour unwanted jet into diesel. Jet traded at a $3.50/bbl discount to diesel inEurope on average in 2020 and was still $1.50/bbl below the more lucrative transport fuel last year. Europe's dieseldemand dipped during the region's Covid-19 lockdowns but was otherwise supported by the economic recovery,increased leisure travel and a reluctance to use public transport. More recently gasoil has benefited from fuel-switching away from expensive natural gas. Supply-Side Support Market participants insist that jet fuel marketsupport is coming mainly from the supply side. Airline buying is still hit by Omicron travel restrictions and staffingproblems and now the cancellation of trans-Atlantic flights due to safety concerns around 5G phone masts near USairports. Europeâ€™s own refiners are still hamstrung by sky-high natural gas prices and rising crude costs whilelifeblood jet imports have flatlined. Brokers now peg East of Suez arrivals in Northwest Europe at just 620,000metric tons or barely a third of pre-pandemic volumes. Volumes are set to rise only marginally to 860,000 tons nextmonth. Regional flight departures were back below two-thirds of 2019 levels this week, according to Europeâ€™snetwork manager Eurocontrol, having briefly gone above 90% of pre-pandemic levels in the run-up to Christmas.Traffic was solidly at 80% of 2019 levels late last year with regional airline fuel demand gaining traction after thereturn of long-haul trans-Atlantic flights in early November. Traders say the recovery exposed the regionâ€™sempty fuel tanks and tattered supply lines. Even if demand has taken a beating again this month, the nervousnessamong traders has not disappeared. 5G cancellations were seen as a bigger problem than Omicron this week asmore European countries look to roll back testing restrictions in the face of the more infectious but less damagingCovid-19 variant. Russiaâ€™s military buildup along its border with Ukraine is also on the radar screens of traders,with any Nato response likely to trigger a regional scramble for jet fuel.Kerry Preston"
Jan 2022;"Fuel Prices Hold at 7-Year High";"Jet fuel prices remained at a seven-year high even as plans by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates sentcrude futures into retreat Thursday. Oil has been on a tear over the past two months. After recovering from theinitial Omicron-demand scare, markets have been pumped up by Opec-plus supply concerns and simmeringgeopolitical tensions between the West and Russia around Ukraine. Crude prices dipped late in the week on fearshigher interest rates would strengthen the dollar.Dollar strength means most countries have to pay more for their oil imports. And when oil is already over $90 perbarrel, further price gains pose a serious threat to the post-Covid-19 economic recovery. International benchmarkBrent ended the week 96Â¢/bbl higher at $89.34/bbl having touched a new high of $91.04/bbl duringThursdayâ€™s trading session before falling back to $89/bbl. US price-pin West Texas Intermediate closed at$86.61/bbl for a gain of $1.06/bbl. Supplies remain extremely tight. The time spread between March and AugustBrent reached $5.30 on Thursday â€ more than $1 per month and the highest in two months. That is the clearestsignal yet that markets see supply trouble in the coming months due to rebounding demand and questions aroundOpec-plusâ€™ ability to meet its production targets. Supply problems are keeping jet fuel prices high in Europeeven as regional airline demand continues to lose altitude. Europeâ€™s own refiners are maximizing jet productionbut key overseas suppliers in the Mideast Gulf are still focused on diesel to meet earlier sales commitments.Eurocontrol data show European air traffic falling from the top end of the network managerâ€™s Covid-19 recoveryforecast last October to the bottom of the range this month. January flight numbers are just 69% of pre-Covid-19levels, down from 73% before Omicron. The most recent week has seen traffic fall to just 63% of pre-pandemiclevels although jet traders expect an uptick now that Omicron travel restrictions and testing regimes are starting tobe rolled back. The UK is set to scrap testing requirements for fully vaccinated travelers from Feb. 11. The newstriggered a 30% spike in flight bookings and prompted tour operators to suggest holiday booking will be back to pre-Covid-19 levels this summer. No cargoes changed hands in Europeâ€™s pricing window this week with upcomingarrivals all committed. Around 860,000 metric tons of jet is due to arrive in Europe next month, up from just 620,000tons in January. European major BP was on its own on the sell-side offering volume from the LR 2 Jo Redwood dueinto Le Havre Feb. 9-11 from India at a steamy $9 per ton premium to Platts c.i.f. cargo mean in Wednesdayâ€™swindow. The major switched to the buy-side on Thursday alongside Chinaâ€™s Unipec and Swiss trader Vitol. BPbid $39/ton over February ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures for late-February delivery into Le Havre. Unipec bidFebruary plus $42/ton for prompt delivery into Rotterdam. Regional tanks remain low with just 840,000 tons of jetheld in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp on Jan. 27, according to Insights Global. Stocks are down 7% on the sametime last year but higher than the record lows scraped in early 2020. Overheated US diesel futures have kept jetfuel markets on the boil. Gains in the Nymex diesel contract have outstripped crude increases, lifting diesel cracksto more than $26/bbl on Thursday. The February contract closed at a seven-year high of $2.80 per gallon andpropelled outright jet quotes into the $2.53-$2.68 range or 19Â¢ above 30-day averages. Jet spreads in Chicagowere the strongest in the country after climbing to a 3Â¢/gallon discount to March diesel futures. Differentials on theGulf Coast weakened slightly to 18.5Â¢ below March values while New York Harbor spreads pegged to Februaryfutures were assessed at a 14Â¢ discount. US jet fuel markets went from rags to riches, with surging imports andlower demand helping to replenish depleted jet fuel stocks. A sharp drop in air traffic and cancellations due towinter storms clipped 235,000 barrels per day off of jet fuel sales, which fell below 1.3 million b/d in the weekended Jan. 21. Refiners have kept output at the 1.5 million b/d mark despite improved jet fuel margins as theyprioritize higher-value diesel. Imports jumped to nearly 200,000 b/d after trending lower earlier in January. The widegap between supply and demand added 2.3 million barrels to jet fuel inventories, which climbed to a two-monthhigh of 37 million bbl. The East and West coasts accounted for all of the increase. Asian jet prices firmed up assteady air traffic in Asiaâ€™s key aviation markets held steady and supported prompt demand. The benchmarkSingapore spot price differential rose by 9Â¢/bbl to a premium of 87Â¢/bbl to Singapore quotes on Jan. 27. At least1.79 million bbl of arbitrage jet has loaded from South Korea and India in the last week of January, according todata intelligence company Kpler.

Jan 2022;"Europe's Recovery On Track Despite Omicron Cancellations";"Europe's air traffic management agency Eurocontrol says the region's flight numbers could still approach pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, even though the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has already caused widespreadcancellations and capacity reductions this month. ""The situation remains enormously challenging â€¦ the unfoldingOmicron situation is pushing many of Europe's top airlines to cut capacity in January by up to 30%, and we arestarting to see some flights canceled due to Covid-19 exposure among crew members,"" says Eurocontrol Director-General Eamonn Brennan. As infections soar, restrictions on flights from South Africa â€ where Omicron was firstidentified â€ have quickly turned into widespread travel bans , especially in Europe. Capacity Cutbacks Leadinglow-cost carrier Ryanair has cut its January capacity by 33% from almost 10 million seats to between 6 million-7million and warned of additional cancellations if travel restrictions remain in place.Lufthansa Group Jan. 5 announced it would be canceling 33,000 flights or around 10% of its service this winterthrough the end of February in response to a sharp drop in bookings. But Eurocontrol insists that European airtraffic is still tracking its base-case scenario under which flight numbers are set to reach 88% of pre-Covid-19 levelsthis year and 95% next year, with a full return to 2019 rates by the end of 2024. Current travel restrictions could beshort-lived. The UK has already abandoned testing requirements for arrivals, on the grounds that domestictransmission of Omicron is already so high. Eurocontrol forecasts, updated Jan. 1, assume booster vaccineinjections remain effective against new Covid-19 variants but that a lack of coordination between different regionscontinues to keep a lid on long-haul journeys outside of Europe this year. Under a far more optimistic scenario, withbetter global cooperation around vaccines and travel passes, traffic and demand for aviation fuel would return topre-Covid-19 levels before the end of this year, according to the agency's analysis. At the opposite extreme, areturn to widespread travel restrictions could push Europe's aviation recovery back to 2027. Market DisconnectEurope's jet fuel market remains disconnected from the harsh realities of the aviation industry for the time being,with traders reporting solid storage demand and healthy purchasing of kerosene for winter heating. ""Demand for jetis actually up,"" says one trader, albeit from a fairly low base. ""It's not all about aircraft flying,"" he adds. The latestInternational Energy Agency (IEA) data show European jet fuel demand 55% below 2019 levels in the nine monthsto end-September at just 23.1 million metric tons (667,400 barrels per day). Demand was up just 0.5% fromdepressed 2020 levels but the data masks a 55% surge in airline buying in the third quarter of 2021 versus 2020.More up to date Eurocontrol figures on airline emissions suggest fuel demand was still around half of 2019 levels inthe 11 months to end-November. The agency says fewer long-distance flights and the mass retirement of older,less fuel-efficient aircraft has depressed fuel uplift in addition to the drop in air traffic. Eurocontrol figures show2021 departures averaging only 56% of 2019 levels, with the bulk of last year's uptick occurring after massvaccination programs were rolled out and after the EU launched its digital vaccination certificate to facilitate travel.Traffic peaked at 81% of 2019 levels in October before falling back to 78% in December. Limited spot tradingactivity over the Christmas/New Year holidays saw cash differentials reach their highest premium since January2020, before Covid-19 infections started to soar in Europe. The latest public deal on Dec. 31 saw European majorBP pay a steamy $41 per ton premium over January ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures for delivery into Rotterdam laterthis month.

Last updated: January 5 2022 Key View • Jet fuel prices are expected to ease from current spot levels and we estimate the 2022 global annual average price to increase by 2.4% y-o-y to USD79.5/bbl as air travel setbacks due to the Omicron variant ease sooner than first though. • Oil price movements are highly correlated to jet prices and we currently forecast oil price gains of 1.5% from 2021 annual averages which accounts for the bulk of upside in jet fuel. Barring a significant resurgence in global lockdown efforts and wider border closures jet fuel demand should return to trend, after the stall in recovery due to Omicron setting the stage flat or declining growth in Q1 2022 consumption. • While the impacts from Omicron remain far from certain, what is clear so far is that domestic and international air travel booking have taken a hit in December setting the stage for continued weakness in air travel for Q1 2022. However, we expect the sharp rise infections to all-time highs along with emerging data pointing to less severity and hospitalisation rates presenting a strong case easing less effective travel restrictions opening the door to renewed air travel in the coming quarters. • Should demand for jet fuel increase substantially more than our current forecast for 2022 this could push our current view for a 2025 return to pre-Covid 19 levels of jet fuel consumption earlier. However, the emergence of new variants remains a risk to this more bullish scenario. US Jet Fuel Prices Post Strong Gains To Close The Year Despite Omicron US New York Jet Spot 2021 Price With 5-Year Average, High And Low,USd/gallon Source: Bloomberg, Fitch SolutionsShort-Term Outlook (3-6 Months) We continue to forecast jet fuel prices to decline from current spot levels in linewith our forecast from Brent prices to decline in 2022 on oil market oversupply building through the year. Theemergence of the Omicron variant in late November saw jet fuel prices and airline passenger numbers fall sharply.However, the emerging data points to less severe illness despite the significantly higher transmissibility of the newvariant. Prices have responded to the positive news and have since recovered most of the losses. It appears thatdue to the highly transmissive nature of the Omicron variant, a wide array of travel restrictions and testingrequirements are proving ineffective at limiting the spread of new infections. As a result, the UK has relaxed testingrequirements from passengers returning from abroad, triggering a surge in future bookings for travel. Should theOmicron wave prove to be short-lived, due to the high number and rapid peaking of infections, we would expect airtravel to return to a recovery trend established during the start of Q3 2021 relatively quickly.In line with theemergence of Omicron, both the number of global commercial flights and US passenger check-ins plateaued ordeclined across the month of December as travel restrictions were tightened to combat the spread of infections.Despite these measures, Omicron can now be found globally with infection numbers breaching all-time highs incountries that were exposed earlier in December. The silver-lining with the rapid spread is that infection ratesshould begin decreasing sooner than with past variant waves, allowing travel restrictions to and most importantlyconsumer sentiment towards air travel, to improve should the variant continue to prove less severe and vaccinescontinue to provide protection against hospitalisation and death. However, the countries that continue to enact ZeroCovid-19 policies, most notably China, will struggle to contain Omicron effectively and will likely impose strictertravel restrictions for longer. In comparison to western developed economies, this will likely lead to reduced uptakein air travel in both the domestic and international travel segments for this key market and related regional travelhubs. Air Travel Recovery Stalls On Omicron Fears 7 Day Average Of Global Commercial Flight Numbers As A Share Of Pre-Covid-19 Levels, % Source: TSA, Flight Radar24, Fitch SolutionsJet fuel margins continue to show improvement although Singapore remains the laggard. 2021 annual average jetfuel price margin to Brent for both New York and Rotterdam increased by nearly 100%, while Singapore posted ameagre 5% gain in margin for 2021 over 2020. A strong recovery in demand in the US and Europe coupled withrestraint in jet fuel production are supporting the wider margins in those regions. It appears Asia is suffering fromthe prevalence of a Zero-Covid-19 policy in many of the regional air travel hubs, which is hurting consumption withstricter travel restrictions and significant curbs on appetite for international travel. Coupled with the rise of newrefining capacity in Asia, ample supply also looks to be challenging Asian refinery margins. However, in a positivestep for Asia, refining margins have posted gains in each of the last three quarters. Should Omicron prove short-lived, it could see border restrictions ease and air travel open sooner than first thought, adding support to strongerjet fuel margins in Asia. Margin Recovery Incomplete On Hobbled Demand Quarterly Spread Front Month Jet Fuel Vs. Brent (2019Q4-2021Q4), USD/bbl Source: Bloomberg, Fitch SolutionsLong-Term Outlook We continue to hold our forecast for annual average Brent prices at USD72/bbl for 2022 whichwill mean a limited growth of just 1.5% y-o-y. We anticipate markets will revert to oversupply through the year asproduction increases from OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers overwhelm the slowing growth in fuel demand. Theaviation sector will continue to post higher passenger numbers and increased number of flights however, increasedflight capacity and short-haul flights will fail to fully return jet fuel consumption to pre-pandemic levels until 2025,according to our latest forecast. The full return in consumption will likely only occur once long-haul flights areresumed in earnest, in response to increased passenger demand. Although pent-up demand is likely to increaseholiday air travel, we expect the declines in international business travel to be substantial in the coming years. Itremains unclear if this key segment of long-haul air travellers will return in similar numbers to pre-Covid times,adding further uncertainty to long-term trends. For now, the best predictor of long-term global jet fuel prices is themovement in the price of oil, which we have trending meekly higher over the coming years. Jet Fuel Prices Move In Lock Step With Oil Brent, WTI and Global Jet Fuel Average Annual Average Price Growth Y-O-Y (1999-2021), % Source: Bloomberg, Fitch SolutionsFundamentals Our view for the fundamentals remains broadly balanced as refiners continue to manage output inline with current consumption trends. Q4 2021 registered consistent drawdowns in US jet fuel stocks signalling ahealthy return in consumption, and was met by further restraint by refiners. Since the start of Q4 2021, US jet fuelstocks have been reduced by 19% from levels at the start of the quarter. The strong drawdown in stocks leaves theend of year balance at 12% below pre-pandemic levels giving prices a strong position to remain elevated to start2022. Returning Air Travel Continues To Erode Stocks Four Week Moving Average Of US Weekly Change In Jet Fuel Stocks, '000 barrels Source: EIA, Fitch SolutionsUS refiners have kept supply broadly consistent across Q4 2021 at 1.5mnb/d of jet fuel supplied to the market.The consistency in supply coupled with the steady uptick in air travel have been key in supporting higher jet fuelmargins during the quarter. Despite the choppiness in oil prices during Q4 2021, US jet fuel prices managed togain 17% across the quarter supporting refiners' decisions to continue to limit production levels. Given the steeprise in prices above the five-year high we expect refiners to eventually increase output to meet the rise inconsumption however, the uncertainty around Omicron has so far limited any meaningful uptick jet fuel production. Refiners Continue To Constrain Production To Support Prices Four Week Moving Average US Jet Fuel Supplied, '000 b/d Source: EIA, Fitch SolutionsRisks To Outlook The balance of risk for jet fuel prices lie to the upside as the worst of global declines in air travelhas passed and a wider roll out of vaccinations spurs reduced travel restrictions and a return of travel for leisure.Any rise of future variants in the vain of the latest Delta and Omicron variants will likely see diminishing impacts asthe appetite for renewed restrictions is limited and medical interventions have improved effective at limiting themortality and severity of infections. Further upside to prices may come in the form of greater than expected pent-updemand which could see increased international travels as vaccinations continue to demonstrate theireffectiveness. A more rapid return of international travel for leisure and business could see demand return fasterthan our current estimate of late 2025. However, the risk of a more virulent variant remains and should existingvaccines prove ineffective a return to lockdown restrictions for key markets should not be underestimated. Globalrefining over capacity could see lower prices in the mid-term though we do not expect this with our current forecast."

The arctic weather inthe US Northeast boosted demand for diesel as a heating fuel at a time when demand from the road transportationsector was also seeing a surge.Gasoline prices also surged across the globe due to increased mobility. Other factors that contributed to the pricesurge included limited supply quotas for exports from China, fuel switching from natural gas to diesel for heating oiland electricity generation, a broader commodity rally globally as well as untapped demand in several oil endmarkets like jet fuel. In addition, the USD has broadly shown a downward trend against a basket of currenciesafter peaking in November-2021.The latest data on Covid-19 suggested that the Omicron variant is signalling a shift to an endemic phase as despiterising cases, the current situation is more manageable than the previous versions of the coronavirus.Recent announcements from several firms in the Europe showed lowering of restrictions and opening of offices tomore staff. A similar stance was seen in the US, although the travel issue with China is yet to be resolved and hasgot more to do with protocols rather than covid-19 cases. Moreover, almost 10 billion vaccine doses have beenadministered globally.On the oil supply front, there were production disruptions reported in several countries including Libya and Ecuadorwhile the unrest in Kazakhstan led to fears of supply disruptions. Russia also mentioned that restoring output afterthe Opec+ reductions won't be as easy due to technical challenges and underinvestment in oil production over thelast few years of oil glut.Opec oil production showed a marginal growth during December-2021 and stayed above the 28 million barrels perday (mb/d) mark at 28.09 mb/d with an increase of 90,000 barrels per day, according to Bloomberg data.Opec secondary sources showed a slightly higher growth as the steep decline in output mainly from Libya andNigeria was partially offset by higher output by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Angola.

Jan 2022;"Global Economic Outlook 2022";"2021 will be remembered as the year of economic revival and the beginning of the end of the pandemic, but alsoas the year in which inflation returned to our lives after a two-decade absence.The year began with a high level of uncertainty, but also hope with the arrival of vaccines. Although the globaleconomy experienced a strong rebound, the recovery was very uneven. This was because vaccination efforts,economic stimulus policies, and restrictions on social mobility varied dramatically by region.The strong rebound in global consumption - driven by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in developedcountries - combined with a series of disruptions in global supply chains - generated by a variety of restrictions oncertain productive activities - led to shortages of a large number of goods.In addition, labor shortages in some developed countries (mainly the United States) also contributed to wagepressures not seen for decades.The combination of the strong economic rebound and rising inflationary pressures led the world's major centralbanks, led by the Fed, to advance the critical path for the start of the normalization of their monetary policies.Although the arrival of the Delta variant in the summer and the inflationary rebound in the second half of the yearcaused a slowdown in economic activity, it is estimated that global GDP may reach 6 percent growth in 2021, upfrom the 5 percent forecast at the beginning of the year.The positive surprise was mainly driven by the United States, where GDP is estimated to reach 5.5% growth in2021 when the original expectation was closer to 4%.Meanwhile, the Eurozone grew close to the 5% forecast and the main negative surprise came from Asia whose 7%growth was below the 8% forecast (both China and Japan underperformed).For 2022, specialists expect the recovery to continue, albeit at a slower pace, with global GDP growth forecast tobe close to 5 percent.The slowdown could be more noticeable in Asia - where a deceleration of 7 to 6% is expected - and in LatinAmerica where GDP could go from an expected growth of close to 6% in 2021 to 2% in 2022.While 2022 could be the year of the end of the pandemic, with Covid-19 becoming endemic, it will also be the yearof the withdrawal of the emergency fiscal and monetary stimuli that were pillars of the 2021 rebound.Many economies laid the groundwork for the rebound to become a sustainable recovery while others simply rodethe wave of the global and/or regional rebound. The most important challenge in 2022 for the global economy willbe to confirm the recovery in an environment of stimulus withdrawal and fighting inflation.joaquinld@eleconomista.com.mx"
Jan 2022;"Global economy: solid normalization";"ESTEBAN POLIDURAAfter the economic crisis that affected the world starting in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus, the recovery tookhold last year and has been sustained over time, marked mainly by government stimulus and policies. In thisregard, we expect economic expansion to continue for three main reasons.First, higher capital spending, as significant productivity gains and persistently low financing costs encourageinvestment. Second, inventory restocking will keep final demand alive. And third, the activation of pent-up demandwill help underpin consumption. On the negative side, monetary and fiscal policy support will diminish, depriving theeconomic expansion of support that had become commonplace. In that context, we expect global economicgrowth of 4.5% in 2022.One of the global powerhouses supporting global growth is the United States, whose advance will be sustained byrising capital spending and healthy consumption patterns. But the checks that boosted purchasing power in 2021will not be repeated to the same degree this year. Therefore, growth rates should slow considerably.We anticipate economic growth for the U.S. of 3.8% in 2022.In the case of Europe, it launched its support programs with some lag compared to the United States. This is whythe rebound in consumption was less intense last year. In 2022, Europe should close this gap with faster growth. Inaddition, the funds to be distributed for investments in the green and digital transition will also contribute to growth.We anticipate economic growth for the eurozone of 5.0% in 2022.Finally, in China, the challenge for this new year will be to balance the policy course adopted to curb excesses andachieve a more sustainable growth path with maintaining sufficient economic growth to ensure that developmenttoward prosperity for all remains realistic. We anticipate economic growth for China of 4.9% in 2022.Along with growth, the issue of global inflation will also be relevant this year. Under that scenario, we expect priceswill not continue to rise as sharply as in 2021, as supply chains should normalize and supply and demand shouldbalance. But inflation will not return to pre-crisis low rates, as some of the supply chains are replaced regionallymany times with less favorable conditions, and some of the higher input costs, such as energy prices or housingcosts, will filter down the supply chain to the consumer."
Feb 2022;"Jet fuel market poised for demand surge during peak summer holiday";" LONDON (ICIS)--Firmness persisted in the European jet kerosene market as aviationdemand appears to be accelerating on intra-European routes, with summer holidaybookings seeing a surge, paving way for uptick in jet fuel consumption rates. • Half-term gateways, summer booking see surge • Market expects demand to near 75% of 2019 levels • Crude rally to support upswing in jet outright values As many European nations dump travel curbs amid falling infection rates and highvaccination rates, easing travel restrictions, largely seeking proof of vaccination fortravellers, has rebounded commercial travel activity across the states and to certain extentinternationally as well. Following the pent-up travel demand, jet fuel consumption rates are expected to surgeduring the Q2 and Q3, compared to first quarter levels. The upwards momentum has supported firmness in European jet kerosene spot valuesstaying steady at late-2014 levels with CIF (cost, insurance & freight) NWE (northwestEurope) prices recorded at $878/tonne on Wednesday. Rallying upstream ICE Brent crude future values, which have soared close to the $95/bblmark earlier in the week, have also contributed to the upswing in aviation fuel prices. Meanwhile, the prompt-month crack spread against rolling Brent has been assessed at$17/bbl, with backwardation seen for the subsequent quarters as crack spread for Q3 andQ4 is averaged at $16.50/bbl. Both jet fuel and gasoil markets are in steep backwardation as sources cited adownward sloping curve with prices seen $100/tonne lower for gasoil and nearly$90/tonne lower for jet fuel towards the end of the year.AVIATION REBOUND RAISES HOPESBookings are soaring for summer holiday period, while activityon local routes have jumped for half-term getaway. Average daily air traffic levels have reached 68% of 2019 levels regionally for the firstnine days of February, according to Eurocontrol's latest data, albeit intercontinental trafficstayed at around -36% compared to 2019 during the period. season Flows between Europe and north Africa increased by 20% as Morocco lifted travellers'flight ban since 7 February 2022, while domestically UK has recorded the highest numberof flights on average in the first 10 days of February, followed by Germany, Spain, Franceand Italy, Eurocontrol stated. With the half-term later this month in the UK, many travellers are embarking on foreigntrips, supporting rebound in both short-haul and long-haul flights. Traffic into the UK is also accelerating after the government dropped the need forpre-departure and post-arrival test for fully vaccinated passengers supporting local tourism. Posing fresh headwinds are the growing Ukrainian tensions which have seen a fewairlines banning their flights, while a few are operating at reduced rates as concerns overrisking the air route mount.CAPPED SUPPLY TO LEND UPSIDECautious refinery throughputs despite steady margins arekeeping supply-side woes at bay with suppliers unwilling to sit on a huge stockpile ofmaterial without enough room to sell it off. Some refineries are already closing down operations for maintenance and with thesummer maintenance period to kick off, outright values are surely to find support. Easing regional supply, besides low level of imports expected to arrive the coming weeks,is likely to lend upside to the prevailing sentiments. That said, for the H1 of February about 850,000 tonnes is hitting European ports,offsetting any impact of supply disruptions. Market players from the aviation industry have indicated that summer bookings are hittinggood highs with traffic to see some normal levels of 2019 starting March, forecasting fueldemand to near 75-80% of pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, market remains cautiously optimistic amid macroeconomic factorspertaining to inflation rates, soaring bank interests and slowing economic growth whichcould potentially dent spending capacity of passengers on leisure and business travels.

Feb 2022;"Sanctions against Russia plunge global economy into new unknown";"Western economic sanctions to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine establish a new set of unknown elementsin a global economy already distorted by the coronavirus pandemic and a decade of ultra-cheap money.The attempt to exclude from the trading system entire parts of the world's 11th largest economy -and supplier ofone-sixth of all commodities- is unprecedented in the globalized era.The sanctions disclosed so far will affect the trading of Russian banks in dollars, euros, pounds and yen.

Feb 2022;"Airlines to raise fuel surcharges on int'l routes in March";"SEOUL-- South Korean airlines are set to raise fuel surcharges on international routes next month as jet fuelprices rise at a faster pace, industry people said Wednesday.Starting March 1, the surcharge for one-way tickets on international routes will range from 18,000 won (US$15) to138,200 won, depending on the routes, a Korean Air official said.The planned hike will raise the surcharges to the highest Level 10 from the current Level 6, which ranges from10,800 won to 80,400 won.In April 2021, rising jet fuel prices prompted local carriers to begin imposing fuel surcharges after a one-yearhiatus. Fuel surcharges on international routes had stayed at zero since April 2020 due to low oil prices sparked bythe COVID-19 pandemic.Local carriers' surcharges vary depending on the level of jet fuel prices traded on the Singaporean market.If the average jet fuel price on the Singapore spot market rises over $1.50 per gallon during the past month, SouthKorean airlines are allowed to impose fuel surcharges starting one month later.Jet fuel prices averaged at $2.43 per gallon on the Singapore market for the one month from Jan. 16 to Feb. 15.The average price is the basis for setting jet fuel surcharges for March.If jet fuel prices drop below the threshold, no surcharge is collected. There are 10 levels of surcharges, dependingon the length of the route.On the domestic routes, fuel surcharges will rise to 8,800 won next month from 5,500 won this month.Source: Yonhap News Agency"
Feb 2022;"Europe Jet, Diesel Prices Respond to Ukraine Crisis";"Europe's jet fuel market would be impacted most by a major military conflict in Ukraine but the region's reliance onimports of ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) from Russia has also been driving diesel prices lately. ""Jet-kerosene is thesingle battlefield grade,"" explains a London-based trader, referring to the fact that Russia uses jet fuel in bothmilitary aircraft and ground vehicles rather than diesel to simplify wartime refueling. ""That is why at times of conflictit increases in value more than any other product,"" he adds.Despite a further escalation of tensions and ominous rhetoric from Moscow this week, a full-blown war has notbroken out yet, and that explains why Europeâ€™s ULSD prices have jumped more than jet. Both fuels are tradingaround seven-year highs, but diesel gained 2.2% over the last week versus an increase of 1.6% for jet. Europedepends on imports of both fuels, but while most of Europe's jet comes from the Middle East, the region reliesheavily on Russian ULSD. Russia has been moving large volumes of jet fuel by rail to its forces along its borderwith Ukraine since the start of the year. Pipeline System Nato meanwhile has its own underground jet fuel pipelinenetwork that links Europe's key refineries and import terminals to its military bases as well as some of the region'sbiggest airports. The Central European Pipeline System (Ceps) handles up to 200,000 barrels per day of fuel, mostof it jet. Commercial oil company and airline volumes dominate in peacetime but all Ceps users have signedcontracts that guarantee fuel supplies to the military at all times. Host countries also use Ceps tanks to hold theirstrategic reserve obligations, against which Nato forces can also draw. The system comprises nearly 5,300kilometers of pipelines, 35 storage depots, 75 pump stations, 16 truck loading facilities and two rail loading stations.Major seaports where tankers and barges unload to feed the system include Le Havre, Dunkirk and Marseille inFrance; Ghent and Antwerp in Belgium; as well as terminals near Rotterdam and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.Ceps is also fed directly from 12 regional refineries. Russia Still Exporting Diesel Tankers were still calling atRussia's main export port of Primorsk to load ULSD on Wednesday. Shipbrokers reported that new fixtures werebeing booked into next week, when a potentially large March ULSD export program is due to be released. Rumorsthat tanker heavyweights Maersk and Heidmar were refusing to call at Russian ports have yet to be confirmed.Western sanctions are not expected to extend to a ban on Russian fuel sales any time soon, while Russian ULSDexporters insist they will continue to supply contracted volumes in full. But analysts are warning that Moscow couldstill decide to tighten the taps in a show of defiance, using essential maintenance work or even a false flagcyberattack as an excuse for cutting ULSD supplies. That risk is already being priced into current ULSD cargonegotiations. The most recent trading window saw bids with a premium of up to $15 per ton over March ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures for fuel delivered in the UK, up from an already hefty $11/ton last week.Kerry Preston"
Feb 2022;"Global economy on pins";"For the sixth consecutive time, Banxico raised its benchmark interest rate; in a few days, the FED will do the same,and the rest of the central banks will follow suit. As a result of the economic imbalance of the last two years, thestill ongoing negative impact of the subprime financial crisis, the disruption of supply chains and the excessiveamount of liquidity required to mitigate the effects of the confinement, economies in many parts of the world areoverheating. Putting these aspects together, we are facing an unexpected global effect that could lead to aneconomic crisis of major proportions; we are witnessing lower than expected levels of economic recovery (allgrowth figures around the world are being adjusted downwards), in addition to frankly high levels of inflation.Lower growth levels with rising prices plus the potential effects on fuel prices as a result of the crisis in Ukraine maygenerate serious imbalances in the risk matrix of the different countries. In the case of inflation, for example, itregisters for the US levels of 7% with growth rates of 4%, for Mexico of 7% with a growth of 5%; Argentina of 57%with 3% growth. Some analysts believe that this episode of high inflation is temporary and that once the supplychains are regularized, the production of microcomponents is normalized and the Covid endemic is over, prices willnaturally tend to fall, economies will grow and high technology will give us a new dawn.In my opinion these good expectations might not materialize, we must assume that everything is hanging by pins.Things are currently calibrated so that, with the exit of the pandemic, cycles will begin to regularize harmoniouslyaccompanied by sensible decisions by monetary and fiscal authorities around the world. Economic nature,however, is not like that. We know that the economy is driven by people with emotions that are not always rational,and the environment adds to this. The negative impact that could be produced in the markets, the aggravation oftensions in Ukraine would be devastating at this time, as would a bad political or financial decision, the eventualemergence of a bank failure or fall in the share prices of corporate giants and even the emergence of strong socialmovements derived from the high global stress that exists and is worsening day by day. Emerging from thenegative effects of Covid to better levels of development in the short and medium term requires a synchronizedprocess that includes significant liquidity withdrawals, relevant fiscal adjustments and prudent geostrategicdecisions, as well as foolproof prudence on the part of large corporations and governments. With any gear that fails,it can complicate our existence as it did 100 years ago."
Feb 2022;"Ukraine's significance to global economy";"An all-out invasion of Ukraine is under way after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a special militaryoperation to support separatists in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. While Mr Putin said the operation was intended to topple the Ukrainian government and demilitarise the country, hedenied having plans to occupy Ukraine.Here is what you need to know about the crisis: <lnvxe_h>What happened'</lnvxe_h>Once a part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent countrywith the collapse of the state in 1991. A nation of 44.1 million people, about 43 per cent to 46 per cent of Ukrainiansconverse in the Russian language despite the separation, and a sizeable segment of the population is pro-Russia. While Russia has maintained close relationships with most of the former Soviet states that broke away from it, tieswith Ukraine have been frosty since a pro-Western revolution in 2014 ushered in politicians inimical to Moscow'sinterests. The revolution - which was sparked by the suspension of an association agreement with the European Union -prompted Russia to invade and annex the Crimean peninsula in the eastern part of Ukraine, which is made upmostly of ethnic Russians. On Monday, Mr Putin further upped the ante by recognising the independence of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk andLuhansk separatist republics, even in areas that were not under their control, despite warnings from the West not todo so. The announcement was made during an hour-long speech laden with historical references in which Mr Putinquestioned Ukraine's right to exist, arguing that the country was ""entirely created by Russia"".""To put it simply, Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,"" United States President JoeBiden said. ""This is the beginning of a Russian invasion.""Russia has claimed that its actions are influenced by Ukraine's ambitions to join the US-led North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation (Nato), which Moscow sees as a red line that would put the alliance's missiles next door. The move to recognise the separatists prompted countries such as the US, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan,besides the EU, to impose sanctions targeting Russian banks and elite members of Mr Putin's inner circle. TheNordstream 2 gas pipeline project from Russia to Germany was also halted in an effort to inflict financial pain onRussia. Page 2 of 3 Ukraine 's significance to global economy But a defiant Mr Putin gave the nod on Thursday for assaults on military facilities across Ukraine, including airfieldsand anti-aircraft systems, as well as the bombardment of capital Kyiv and other cities. That has provoked evenmore punishing sanctions that will affect Russia's ability to access the global financial system, as well as keytechnologies. <lnvxe_h>Why it matters</lnvxe_h>A war between Russia on one side and Ukraine and its Western allies on theother could have a catastrophic impact not only in terms of lives lost and destruction, but also on a globaleconomy yet to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Oil and gas are the main exports of the Russian economy, and there have already been warnings of gas pricesrising in Europe following the imposition of sanctions. Meanwhile, Ukraine is known for holding the second-largest gas deposits in Europe, though they are largelyunexploited. Crude oil prices have crossed US$100 a barrel - their highest level since 2014 - amid the uncertainty. In addition, both Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers of grain and edible oils, resulting in global food pricesshooting up because of the geopolitical uncertainty. Casualties, meanwhile, are beginning to tick upwards, with Ukraine announcing on the first day of the invasion thatat least 50 people had been killed. Dozens of Russian fatalities are believed to have also occurred. There have been ballistic missile strikes on Kyiv and other population centres, with people urged to go to shelters.With Russian ground forces now well inside Ukraine's border, fighting has also escalated and there have beenreports of Russian military planes and helicopters being shot down. The war is asymmetric, with Russia's massive army more than capable of overwhelming Ukraine's smaller militarydespite the latter's upgrades in recent years and aid from Western backers. Nato has clarified that it will not be sending troops into Ukraine, dealing a blow to Ukrainian hopes of moreinternational involvement, but the indirect support of the US and its allies could make the conflict a drawn-out affair.<lnvxe_h>What is next'</lnvxe_h>For the time being, it looks like diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis have failed,with negotiations called off after the belligerent Russian moves. Whether there is still scope for a climbdown by the parties involved remains to be seen, but chances are lookingslim that cooler heads will prevail in the near term as Russian forces move to take Kyiv."
Feb 2022;"Resolve Russia-Ukraine conflict through talks to save global economy ICCI";" The business community during a meeting at Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) expressedgreat concerns over the Russian-Ukraine conflict that carries great risks to the economies of the world and calledfor resolving this crisis through talks to save the global economy from its serious consequences.Addressing the meeting, Muhammad Shakeel Munir, President, Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industrysaid that the global economy was still struggling to come out of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, but this crisishas unleashed new challenges for the world as the oil prices in the international market has already started to moveup while the global prices of energy, food commodities and many other items would also become more expansivethat would give rise to global inflation and make the lives of common man more miserable.ICCI President said that any disruption in the flow of gas, oil and trade in the conflict zone would have a majorimpact on almost all countries of the world and add further fuel to the food inflation at global level.He said that the businesses and people in Pakistan have already started to feel the economic fallout of this conflict,just like people elsewhere in the world. He appealed to the United Nations and the world leaders to play a role infinding a peaceful settlement of this conflict through talks and negotiations in order to save the world from itsdevastating consequences.Muhammad Shakeel Munir said that Europe was importing close to 40% of its natural gas from Russia and Europewas also a big market for Pakistani textiles and other products. So any disruption in that energy source would affectthe economies of Europe that would have a major fallout on Pakistani exports.He said that the Central Asian region including the Russian Federation was a huge market for Pakistan to improvetrade and exports. So Pakistan should work with the global community to consider all peaceful options for endingthis crisis as soon as possible in order to keep the global trade channels open and curb the further escalation in theworld energy and food prices."
Feb 2022;"Fears conflict will cause global economic pain";"A Russian invasion of Ukraine could push oil prices above $US120 a barrel and lead to a global supply shock thatdrives inflation higher and hits still-fragile consumer confidence following the omicron COVID-19 wave.With more than 130,000 Russian troops staged on the Ukraine border, US officials at the weekend warned aninvasion could come at any time.Higher oil prices sparked by war would hit households at the petrol bowser and further drive up headline inflation,said Andrew Ticehurst, economist and rates strategist at Nomura Australia.Oil prices surged to seven-year highs on Monday and come after the national average unleaded petrol price lastweek rose by 5 cents to a record 176.9 cents a litre, according to the Australian Institute of Petroleum.""It could also act as a tax on growth for consumers, having a negative impact on confidence and consumption,"" MrTicehurst said. That could force a rethink of the Reserve Bank of Australia's outlook for interest rate hikes.But at the same time, a surge in the oil price would result in a rise in coal and liquified natural gas (LNG) prices asbuyers searched for energy substitutes. As a major exporter of both, Australia would benefit from that rise.""There may be winners and losers, but at an aggregate level [an invasion] may not have much of an impact on theeconomy,"" Mr Ticehurst said.Australian commodity exporters would be among the winners. In addition to energy substitutes, producers of safehaven assets such as gold are usually beneficiaries of geopolitical uncertainty.A rush of capital into safe havens such as the US would also drive down the Aussie dollar. That would be good forresource companies that repatriate profits, but would also add upward pressure to tradable inflation.Analysts said the uncertainty of the situation on the Russian border made predicting flow-through effects difficult,but there were certainly plausible scenarios where military action led to a global energy supply shock.For many, the biggest uncertainty is what, if any, national-level sanctions are imposed on Russia and how theKremlin would respond.""You want to make sure sanctions don't hurt you more than they do Russia,"" Commonwealth Bank commoditiesanalyst Vivek Dhar said, noting Russia would likely retaliate against any national-level sanctions.Russia pipes about 250,000 barrels of oil a day, or 0.25 per cent of global supply, through Ukraine. More broadly,Russia accounts for about 8 per cent of global supply, after discounting production for domestic use, making it theworld's third-largest producer.The International Energy Agency on Friday labelled the likelihood of national sanctions as ""remote"". But in its OilMarket Report, the IEA also said global oil balances were much tighter than previously thought.""Chronic underperformance by OPEC+ [the global cartel of oil producing nations] in meeting its output targets andrising geopolitical tensions have propelled oil prices higher,"" the IEA said.Mr Dhar said the global oil stockpiles and limited OPEC+ spare capacity suggested that oil markets were morevulnerable to supply shocks, and the ""primary supply shock on the market's mind"" was Ukraine.From a monetary policy perspective, Mr Ticehurst said the RBA would likely look through short-term price impacts,though BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese warned prolonged higher prices would be hard to ignore.""If oil prices went over $100 a barrel and stayed there it would be a further shock to consumer spending,"" he said.""If it's a negative supply shock al la the 1970s it's going to be very hard for central banks to ignore. Depending onhow long that lasts it could tip the global economy into recession."""

Mar 2022;"Ukraine War Triggers Jet Fuel Pricing Chaos";"The UK's ban on Russian diesel imports dislocated Europe's jet fuel market from its benchmark ICE gasoil futuresand sparked trading chaos. European jet fuel differentials went more than $300 per metric ton below the screenafter the UK move to ban Russian energy imports sparked panic in diesel circles. More than half of Europeâ€™sprice-setting diesel imports come from Russia with one in every six gallons of fuel sold in the UK coming from thenow pariah state. The regionâ€™s jet fuel market shares the ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) contract with diesel buthas a completely different dynamic. Jet imports mainly come from the Mideast and Asia while Europe's fueldemand has still not recovered from Covid-19. Traders reckon airline fuel demand is still barely half pre-pandemiclevels while Natoâ€™s refusal to engage in Ukraine means anticipated military fuel demand has not materialized.Headline-grabbing Brent crude oil futures hit a near-14-year high of almost $130 per barrel on news of the US-UKembargo of Russian oil imports. The move sent a powerful signal that Western nations are willing to accepteconomic pain by cutting off supplies from the worldâ€™s biggest oil exporter. Russiaâ€™s Deputy Prime MinisterAlexander Novak warned that a similar boycott of Russian oil by the EU could send prices as high as $300/bbl. Theblocâ€™s leaders are meeting today to discuss just that after parliamentarians endorsed an oil ban. The EU isalready working to cut dependence on Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of the year. Signs that some ofRussiaâ€™s Opec-plus colleagues are moving to fill the gap sent prices into reverse, as did preparations byconsuming countries to release more emergency stocks. International benchmark Brent finished the week $1.13/bbllower at $109.33/bbl Thursday. US price pin West Texas Intermediate shed $1.65/bbl to finish at $106.02/bbl.Prices fell particularly sharply after the Financial Times reported that the United Arab Emirates' influentialambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, favors lifting production to help offset the loss of Russian supplies.Iraq is also reportedly ready to raise production if called upon to do so by the Opec-plus coalition. Analysis byEnergy Intelligence shows that there is very little oil producers can do to offset the loss of Russian volumes at leastin the short term. Energy Intelligence data suggest the UAE has roughly 750,000 barrels per day of spare capacity itcould quickly bring on line, while Iraq has just over 100,000 b/d. That is nowhere near enough to offset the outagesfrom Russia; Energy Intelligence estimates that combined exports of Russian crude oil and petroleum productshave already fallen by 3 million b/d as buyers shun Russian barrels. European jet cargoes were pegged at a neverbefore seen $316.25 discount to roller-coaster March ICE LSGO futures by benchmark price provider Standard &Poor Platts at Wednesdayâ€™s close, down from an already-unheard of $125.25/ton discount reported Tuesday.By Thursdayâ€™s close, cargoes were back up to a $58.75/ton premium. Traders say theyâ€™ve never seenanything like it. Even in the depths of Covid-19 demand destruction cargo discounts stayed in double digits.â€œItâ€™s all a little bit broken,â€ said one with characteristic understatement. ICE gasoil futures have been farmore volatile than headline-grabbing crude: March ICE LSGO futures leapt 20% on the UK Mar. 8 announcement,versus a comparatively modest 7% jump in Brent crude. Brent is now 10% higher than before the Russian invasionwhereas LSGO is up by more than 20% Nothing has traded in Europeâ€™s price-setting market-on-close windowsince the market hiatus. The last cargo deal was on Monday when Saudi Aramco pounced on a bid from Chinesetrader Unipec looking for prompt Mar. 17-23 delivery into Rotterdam. That deal was struck at a $4/ton premium tothe Platts c.i.f. cargo mean. Extreme market volatility makes such floating deals a necessity for most with bothUnipec and European major BP still bidding Platts-related throughout the weekâ€™s price roller coaster. OnlySwiss trader Vitol was seen bidding at a $15/ton premium to April ICE LSGO futures in Thursdayâ€™s window â€equivalent to March plus $60/ton at the time. US jet fuel markets similarly whipsawed with the massive fluctuationsin Nymex diesel futures this week. A record 97Â¢ per gallon plunge in the April futures contract on Wednesdayerased the 65Â¢/gallon gain posted early in the week as panic around diesel supplies sparked a trading frenzy. Thegyrations defied reality, since US refiners were already replacing some of their 345,000 b/d Russian feedstockimports with supplies from Algeria and Iraq. The US downstream sector needs straight-run residuals and vacuumgasoil to balance their slate for mid-distillates production. US product exports are rising rapidly to offset bannedRussian barrels in Europe. Kpler data show diesel shipments out of the US ramped up to 2.1 million barrels so far inMarch versus 1.23 million in February. But a heavier refinery maintenance season may curb those flows headinginto the second quarter. Average US spot jet prices on Thursday at $3.15/gallon were still 50Â¢/gallon higher thanprior to Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. Surging jet differentials offset some of the futures gain. Jet spreads onthe East and West coasts tacked on more than 22Â¢/gallon to trade at a 12Â¢/gallon discount in New York Harborand 25Â¢/gallon below the print in Los Angeles. Relatively stable fundamentals belied the volatility in the futuresmarket. Jet fuel output in the week ended Mar. 4 stayed above the 1.5 million b/d mark for the fourth week in arow. Sales weakened by 117,000 b/d to 1.35 million b/d in a typical March downturn before spring travel kicks in.Storage tanks swelled by 1 million bbl to 39.2 million bbl with a huge buildup on the Gulf Coast. Jet fuel importsflowed in at hefty rates of 146,000 b/d even as soaring prices in Europe start to draw in more cargoes from Asia.Asia's benchmark Singapore spot price differential hit a new all-time high as the Ukraine war sparked a scramble tosecure prompt supplies. Singapore spot price differentials were pegged at a $4.41/bbl premium to Singaporequotes on Mar. 9 â€ the highest level seen in Energy Intelligence records dating back to May 2007. Even a slightreversal to $3.60/bbl over Singapore quotes by Thursday's close, left differentials $1.31/bbl higher than a week ago.The week saw one jet fuel deal: Swiss trader Vitol sold 200,000 bbl of late March-loading jet to Unipec at apremium of $3.80/bbl to Singapore quotes on Mar. 8.

Mar 2022;"Russia's war and the global economy";" Members of the Ukrainian army scour an abandoned supermarket in Kiev for water and food.EFE/EPA/ROMAN PILIPEYPhoto: ROMAN PILIPEYNowthat Russian President Vladimir Putin has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we must consider theeconomic and financial consequences of this gigantic historical outcome. The war in Ukraine is not another minorconflict without global consequences like those that have occurred in recent decades. It is a major escalation of theSecond Cold War, with four revisionist powers - China, Russia, Iran and North Korea - increasingly challenging thelong-standing global dominance of the United States and the Western-led international order that was created afterWorld War II.The risk now is that markets and political analysts underestimate the implications of this global regime change. Atthe market close on February 24 - the day of the invasion - U.S. stock markets had rallied on hopes that the warwould slow down rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve. However, in terms of the broader economy, a globalstagflationary recession today is immensely feasible. Analysts are wondering whether the Fed and other majorcentral banks will be able to achieve a soft landing after this crisis and its aftermath. Don't count on it.

Mar 2022;"Spike in European jet fuel spot prices may lead to demand destruction";" LONDON (ICIS)--A constant increase in European jet fuel spot values, which are nearingtheir 2008 highs following a rally in upstream Brent crude and ICE gasoil futures, has notonly dented trading activity but is also likely to push the market into 'demand destruction'territory. A spike in prices has seen a fall in trade in the open market, although some traders havepushed differentials higher - indicating tighter market availability amid reduced refinerythroughput and a lack of imports. Sanctions on Russian barrels have caused tightness in the gasoil and diesel markets,and encouraged local refiners to blend more kerosene into their diesel pool, especially asmargins for gasoil have surged to historic highs. Gasoil prices are at all-time highs and trading at these levels due limited inflows fromRussia, which accounts for nearly 60% of total European imports. As a result, local jet production is relatively reduced, and together with a negligible levelof imports, this has exacerbated limited regional availability and pushed differentialshigher. ""The market is all over the place with more bids than offers noted,"" a jet fuel tradersaid. Jet differentials to ICE gasoil futures have spiked by three-digits for barges, whilecargoes are hovering around the late $80s/tonne.PEAK SUMMER DEMAND TO EXTEND UPSIDEAlthough most airlines are hedged againstskyrocketing jet fuel prices, some spot buying is always part and parcel of the business. ""Better expensive than not for sale,"" a jet fuel buyer said citing the recent spike in themarket. That said, the upside risk is likely to increase in the approach to the peak summertravel season which is likely to push jet spot values higher in the absence of availability. ""Sanctions are likely to stay on Russia, at least in the near term, with little room forany resolution to trading pact, worsening supply-side fundamentals,"" a jet fuel traderpointed out. As such, prices could see a further upward push in the approach to summer, and thiscould result in demand destruction if airlines fail to absorb and pass on the rise in costs. The road to recovery for the aviation industry is nonetheless expected to be long andarduous given the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the emergence of anothercoronavirus wave in Asia, which have dented both passenger confidence and trafficnumbers.FRESH HEADWINDSThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has seen a reduction in traffic on bothregional and international routes, notably after the ban imposed by 36 countries on use oftheir airspace by Russian aircraft - to which latter retaliated. The closure of the Ukrainian airspace to civilian flights since 24 February, and theclosure of Russian airspace for 36 countries since 28 February has forced cancellations andextended trajectories. This resulted in a significant reduction in flights between Europe and other Europe(including Russia) in the week ending 16 March, which were down 43% on the previous week anddown 87% compared to the same week in 2019, according to the latest data from Eurocontrol. Intra-Europe flights were down 24% compared with 2019 and intercontinental flights down35%. At the same time, renewed lockdowns in China following a surge in coronavirus cases,has limited international travel in the region. This fails to include the impact of macroeconomic factors including risinginflation on the jet fuel market, which are also likely to keep a cap on consumption. Focus article by Shruti Salwan"
Mar 2022;"European Snapshot: Stocks Drain to Rock Bottom Levels";"European jet fuel stocks ended the year at rock-bottom levels as regional refiners focused on production of higher-value diesel. The lean inventory cushion made jet fuel markets especially vulnerable to price spikes as 2022 gotunderway. At just 8.6 million tons by end-December, tank levels reached multiyear lows and were 24% below year-earlier rates. Inventories have consistently dwindled from ample levels above 11 million tons in January. Lowerimport arrivals through the summer months also kept a lid on supplies. Markets were ill-equipped to handle thegradual recovery in regional jet fuel demand, which reached 3.7 million tons at year's end.

The April contract of West Texas Intermediate was $100.77 per barrel,higher by 6.03% from its previous close.""The prospect of large-scale disruptions to Russian oil production is threatening to create a global oil supply shock.We estimate that from April, 3 million barrels per day (mbpd) of Russian oil output could be shut in as sanctionstake hold and buyers shun exports. Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec))+ is, for now,sticking to its agreement to increase supply by modest monthly amounts,"" IEA said in its report.Only Saudi Arabia and the UAE hold substantial spare capacity that could immediately help offset a Russianshortfall, it said.Earlier this month, the agency also announced that its member countries will release 61.7 million barrels of oil underits emergency response plan to alleviate the increasing tightness in oil markets.High oil prices are a cause of concern for India as the country imports 85% of its oil demand.The recent surge in global crude also pushed up the price of Indian energy basket, comprising of Oman, Dubai andBrent crude. It was last recorded at $103.50 per barrel on 16 March, according to data from the petroleum planningand analysis cell of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.The increase in the price of crude oil has not been transferred to consumers of petrol and diesel.

Mar 2022;"Global economic uncertainty grows";"Amid widespread concerns about the Ukraine crisis, the crude oil price hit more than $110 a barrel on Wednesday,the highest since 2013, and the benchmark natural gas price soared 55 percent, hitting $2,200 per kilostere, ahistorical record.While the United States and Europe have so far refrained from imposing sanctions directly on Russiancommodities, including oil and gas, to prevent already high inflation from spiraling out of control, the sanctions onRussia's financial sector will necessarily hurt commodities trading and send shipping costs soaring.The continuous rise of commodity prices may drag down the growth of some major economies and further fuelinflation, bringing the risk of global stagflation. This will create great uncertainty for the recovering global economyand increase the likelihood of a global recession. The stability of US markets and its economic growth could bethreatened if the Fed does not act decisively to tame the US' inflation.The European Union, perhaps the economy hardest hit by the Ukraine crisis, is heavily dependent on Russia forresources. Rising oil and gas and food prices will further increase the inflationary pressure in the EU, and sanctionsagainst Russia may also hit the EU countries. In addition, the EU countries may increase their defense spendingand fiscal deficits, and the EU's uneven economic performance could push some countries into recession first.So far, Russia has not responded to the US-led sanctions. In addition to its oil and gas resources, Russia accountsfor more than 10 percent of the global supply of palladium, antimony, vanadium, platinum, titanium, nickel, gold andother metals, with palladium and antimony each accounting for more than 20 percent of the global market.In general, the global economy faces the risk of continuous uncertainty in the commodity market and inflationarypressure, which increases the possibility of global economic recession this year.In this context, China's status as a ""global safe haven"" is being strengthened.

Mar 2022;"GLOBAL ECONOMY GRIPPED";"FRESH STAGFLATION FEARSHOUSEHOLDS FACE SOARING LIVING COSTS AS RECOVERY STALLSBY LUCY WHITETHE spectre of stagflation is stalking the global economy as growth slows and the cost of living soars.Prices of commodities from nickel to wheat are all on the rise due to sanctions slapped on Russia by the West in anattempt to end Vladimir Putin's bloody rampage in Ukraine.Stagflation - where an economy stagnates, but inflation is rife - is considered a disaster for governments andhouseholds.It usually means that while prices rise, wages remain flat, forcing families to cut their spending and even pushinglow-income households into poverty.Businesses, meanwhile, see their costs climb, but the lower level of activity in the economy means there is littlethey can do to meet these expenses. Now economists are becoming increasingly worried that stagflation couldbecome a reality.Britain's FTSE 100 index has fallen 7.2pc so far this year.America's S&P 500 is down by 13pc since the turn of the year, as the tech giants which make up so much of the USstock market have taken a beating.And the Shanghai Composite index, which contains China's biggest companies, has slumped 9.3pc since the turnof 2022.Stagflation is the fear stalking the markets right now and the longer the war rages, the more likely this scenariobecomes,' said AJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould.According to the Centre for Business and Economic Research (CEBR), the harm could be drastic. It has cut itsgrowth forecasts for the UK for this year from 4.2pc to 1.9pc, costing the economy £51.4bn. Next year, another£42.5bn will be shaved off as output flatlines.The CEBR is also warning that the economy will tumble into recession with three consecutive quarters ofcontraction expected in 2023. Inflation could hit a 40-year high of 8.7pc, the CEBR warned, and instead of fallingback towards the Bank of England's 2pc target later this year it is likely to stay around 7pc until early 2023. Theeffect on households would be devastating. Many are already feeling the pain, as inflation hit a 30-year high of5.5pc in January, with those on low incomes edging even closer towards the breadline.Others forecasts are less pessimistic. Thomas Pugh, an economist at accountancy firm RSM, thinks the UK will stillgrow by 3.5pc this year.But industrial users of gas and electricity - such as steel manufacturers and factories - may opt to temporarily shutdown rather than pay the sky-high prices for their energy, he said. This could threaten thousands of jobs and lead tomore shortages of items from metals to computer chips.Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, said 2022 could be a painful year for Britons even if growthdoesn't technically grind to a standstill.But growth is going to be lower. There will be a squeeze on real incomes and inflation will be higher, so it will feellike stagflation. People won't feel like things are good.'The events in Ukraine will have caused a headache for policymakers at the Bank of England, who are due to maketheir latest decision on interest rates next week. Soaring inflation increases the need that they will have to hikerates, in an effort to encourage households and businesses to save rather than spend and bring down prices.But this could threaten the economic recovery even more, causing firms to hold back on investment andhouseholds to hoard their money.Whatever the decision on Threadneedle Street, Britons face a turbulent few months.© Daily Mail"
Mar 2022;"Ukraine war fuels global economic downturn";" The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been the main contributing factor to the potentially devastating one percentdrop in projected global economic growth this year, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD).""We anticipated back in September of last year that the global economy would grow by around 3.6 percent,"" saidRichard Kozul-Wright, director of UNCTAD Division on Globalisation and Development Strategies, Thursday.""We expect it to grow by 2.6 percent this year; and of course, the main contributing factor to that is the war inUkraine.""With inflation on the rise and developing countries already weighed down by a $1 trillion debt burden to pay back tocreditors, the UN body decried the inadequate financial measures already taken to help them withstand exchangerate instability, rising interest rates and soaring food and fuel prices.Wholesale multilateral fiscal reform - possibly on the scale and ambition of the US Marshall Plan that shoulderedWestern Europe following the Second World War - is urgently needed to improve the financial liquidity of developingcountries to prevent them - and even middle-income countries - from potentially going under, UNCTAD said.""There is a rapidly worsening outlook for the world's economy and to think that this year, the year after two years ofcrisis with Covid-19, the average rate of growth of the world economy will be 2.6 percent, down from 5.5 percentlast year, and down from the projections that were made in the last quarter of 2021,"" said UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan.She called for emergency measures from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, namely theactivation of rapid funding instruments which the IMF can provide to help countries with looming balance ofpayments problems.""Conditions are worsening for everybody,"" Rebeca said, noting how the climate crisis has played its part, along withsuccessive droughts in the Horn of Africa, the ongoing pandemic and war in Ukraine.Even relatively wealthy countries that are struggling with multiple cost-of-living pressures have already sought helpfrom the international system to keep them afloat.""Pakistan went back (to the IMF) at the end of last year,"" said Kozul-Wright. ""Sri Lanka has now gone to the IMF toorganise a programme. Egypt, which was already under a programme, has gone back to the IMF to renegotiate.""""And these are not least developed countries, these are middle-income countries that are under very seriouseconomic and in some cases political pressure, as a consequence of the shocks that they now face.""But it is the world's poorest, import-dependent countries that will be worst hit by the global economic downturn,UNCTAD said.""The brunt is being carried by the developing countries because of the rise in prices of food, of energy and fertilisersthat is very steep and also the financial stretch under which the developing countries are already under,"" saidRebeca.Although ""all regions of the global economy will be adversely affected by this crisis,"" Kozul-Wright suggested that""high commodity exporters"" were likely to do well from a rise in prices. ""But the European Union will see a fairlysignificant downgrade in its growth performance this year...so will parts of central and southern Asia as well.""UNCTAD's policy recommendations include the need for global financial reform to allow developing countries theeconomic space for ""reasonable growth"" so that they can service potentially crippling debt levels.""Debt servicing in 2020 for developing countries excluding China was already $1 trillion, that was the kind offinancial pressure that developing countries are in,"" Kozul-Wright said."

Apr 2022;"Jet Fuel Crisis Looms as Refiners Continue to Prioritize Diesel";"Traders complain â€œthere is just not enough jet fuel in the world,â€ as Russia's war in Ukraine forces refiners tostay focused on diesel. At current premia, refiners should be focusing on jet. But Russian supply fears, and slightlyless frantic airline buying after the Easter holidays, means they are still maximizing production of road fuels.â€œNo one buys again until itâ€™s too late,â€ the trader adds, amid mounting fears of jet fuel shortages thissummer.European carriers were already having to tanker in fuel to some destinations in Africa this week. Crude oil priceswere barely changed over the week but jet fuel and diesel prices are still on a sharp upward trajectory. â€œWhatthe market is losing from Russian supply is offset by what the market is losing in Chinese demand from the Covidlockdowns,â€ says a crude trading source. He nevertheless warns that while Russian supply is set to declinefurther, Chinese demand is certainly primed for recovery. International benchmark Brent finished at $108.33 perbarrel at Thursdayâ€™s close, down 45Â¢/bbl on the disrupted Easter trading week, while US price pin West TexasIntermediate shed 46Â¢/bbl to end the week at $103.79/bbl. Russiaâ€™s oil production is down 1.1 million barrelsper day compared to prewar levels, but the country's crude exports are holding up so far with far less going todomestic Russian refiners and pipeline operator Transneft selling oil out of storage. The International EnergyAgency meanwhile reckons China is currently losing 780,000 b/d from its zero-Covid-19 policy. Russian dieselexports are set to fall sharply next month as lower domestic refinery runs start to bite and EU sanctions step up agear. All but â€œstrictly necessaryâ€ oil and fuel transactions with majority state-run firms are banned from May 15under the EUâ€™s fourth round of sanctions. Traders are taking that to mean term volumes will still be allowed, atleast until current contracts expire. Onward spot sales by unsanctioned traders may also be permitted but lots ofbuyers are already requesting non-Russian fuel, despite market discounts of at least $20 per ton, for fear of beingaccused of funding Putinâ€™s war machine. That thirst for non-Russian diesel is already impacting jet fuel flows toEurope from key suppliers Saudi Arabia and India even before summer airline demand kicks in. Europeâ€™sbenchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures finished the week 7% higher at $1,130/ton Thursday with tradersspooked by another drop in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) gasoil tanks to a new record low of 1.439 milliontons, according to Insights Global. ARA jet stocks are also falling but at 897,000 tons on Apr. 21 remain just abovelevels seen this time last year. Tanks are obviously much lower in terms of days of forward cover, now that airlinedemand is recovering. Regional departures were up to 82.5% of pre-Covid-19 levels in the 10 days to Apr. 21,according to Eurocontrol, compared to just 36.5% the same time last year. The week saw one jet cargo deal:Chinaâ€™s Unipec selling 30,000 tons to BP into the UKâ€™s Isle of Grain Apr. 30-May 4 at a $40/ton premium toPlattsâ€™ benchmark c.i.f. cargo mean (CCM) in Wednesdayâ€™s window. Thursday saw BP bidding for morenon-Russian jet into the Isle of Grain at a $100/ton premium to May ICE LSGO futures versus offers from Unipec atMay plus $121/ton or CCM plus $30/ton into Rotterdam. Tightness in US jet fuel markets eased slightly butoutright prices remain at record highs of $3.72-$4.60 per gallon due to a 30Â¢ surge in Nymex diesel futures on theweek. The May contract closed at $3.90/gallon on Thursday as diesel prices continue their ascent. Refiners haveramped up jet fuel output to 1.68 million b/d to capture robust jet fuel margins and supply strong demand indomestic and export markets. At downstream utilization rates of 91%, jet fuel yields have climbed to more than10%. Higher import volumes have replenished depleted tanks on the East Coast, where New York Harbor jetspreads receded from a staggering $4/gallon in early April to 69Â¢ on Thursday. Airlines are heading into the peaktravel season with jet stocks at precariously lean levels. A 2 million barrel jump in East Coast tanks was partly offsetby a 1.5 million bbl drawdown on the Gulf Coast, keeping overall inventories at multiyear lows of 35.4 million bbl.US airline CEOs are confident that record summer bookings will bring air travel close to pre-pandemic levels.Airlines are shifting aircraft to the trans-Atlantic corridor to accommodate the traffic surge to European destinationsand offset weak demand in Asia. They expect that higher revenues can offset higher jet fuel costs and yield a profitfor the second quarter, after most carriers reported losses in the first quarter. Jet fuel sales in the week ended Apr.15 fell by 77,000 b/d to 1.52 million b/d as passenger numbers ebbed after the Easter holiday. Asian jet marketsweakened again under pressure from falling prompt demand in China.

Apr 2022;"Russia parries off Ukraine invasion blame for global economic crisis";" The Russian government has rejected recent news reporting with the narrative that its invasion of Ukraine has ledto a global economic crisis.Russia is currently engaged in a war with Ukraine, a move that has led to severalsanctions being placed on the Eastern European super power.The International Monetary Fund has said that the economic damage caused byRussia's invasion of Ukrainewilllead to a significant slowdown in global growth in 2022.The IMF said in its latest update of the World EconomicOutlook report released on Tuesday that the global economy is now expected to grow 3.6%, down0.8% from thefund's January forecast, due to the war and its impact.The fund expects both Russia and Ukraine to experience steep contractions this year, with spillover effects such assurging commodity prices affecting countries across the world.The report shows Ukraine suffering a 35% collapseof its economy, while Russia's GDP will shrink 8.5%.""The effects of the war will propagate far and wide, adding to price pressures and exacerbating significant policychallenges,""IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog post on April 19.Many Africangovernments are also blaming their economic woes on the current happenings in Ukraine.The Russian Embassy in Ghana's capital Accra has taken to its Twitter account to share series of threads ofrebuttal saying its government's invasion of Ukraine cannot be the cause of the current economic crisis of manycountries.The Kremlin's representative in Accra explained that the current situation in the food market, for instance,started two years ago and ""not a result of two months of this year"".Source: Africafeeds.comSource: Africa Feedsp"
Apr 2022;"'Parabolic.' NY jet fuel prices double in the past two weeks to record highs";" The price of New York Harbor jet fuel has more than doubled in the past two weeks, reaching an all-timehigh for any US-traded transportation fuel in at least the past 41 years, according to the Oil Price InformationService.The wholesale price for NY jet fuel spiked to $7.57 a gallon on Tuesday, up from $3.63 a gallon two weeks ago,data provided by OPIS showed.""This is the most parabolic move I've seen in decades, and it cannot be credited to simple supply and demandeconomics,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at OPIS. ""I've never seen anything like it.""Kloza predicted prices will ""drop like a rock"" very soon, but cautioned that travelers may still see at least a near-term bump in airfares if they didn't book ahead.""The consumer will see an impact in fares. There's no question about it. Or they will see airlines cut back on flights,""Kloza said.The jet fuel spike is a reversal of fortunes after the collapse in air travel during the onset of Covid.NY jet fuel plunged below $1 and stayed there for much of 2020, before rebounding to end last year below $2.30 agallon, according to OPIS. Even when oil prices skyrocketed to record highs in 2008, NY jet fuel topped out at$4.36 a gallon.Today's prices are not only all-time records for NY jet fuel, but the highest for any transportation fuel traded in theUnited States in the 41-year history of OPIS, Kloza said.The spike points to a localized supply problem because other markets for jet fuel are seeing much lower prices.Gulf Coast jet fuel, for instance, trades at $3.78 a gallon, OPIS data showed.Analysts at S&P Global pointed to how some US refineries in recent weeks have focused on producing dieselinstead of jet fuel. S&P said by the end of March, US refineries were producing ultra-low sulfur diesel at a seven-month high, while jet fuel output fell to a four-month low.However, Kloza does not believe there is a link to the US ban on Russian oil and petroleum products, nor the defacto ban on Russian energy that has emerged since the invasion of Ukraine.Instead, he pointed to a lack of liquidity in ""broken"" energy markets and a GameStop-like momentum swing.""You've gone parabolic because somebody desperately needs jet fuel and the people who have it aren't releasingit for the moment,"" Kloza said, adding there is an ""incredible note of desperation"" among buyers.

Apr 2022;"Sanctions Force Russia to Slash Refinery Runs";"Russia's refining runs crashed by more than 11% on the month in March as oil companies grappled with a glut ofdirty products and a lack of buyers for middle distillates, the result of sanctions both formal and informal. Runs weredown a hefty 670,000 barrels per day from February. Paradoxically, many refiners scored the highest margins onrecord thanks to state subsidies that reimburse them for every ton of diesel and gasoline sold on the domesticmarket. Analysts say the fall in throughput will continue in April, and even longer if the conflict in Ukraine worsensor if the West decides to act on allegations of war crimes, which could result in further cuts in purchases of Russiancrude oil and oil products.In March, Russiaâ€™s refining industry, the worldâ€™s third largest, processed an average 5.24 million b/d ofcrude, according to Energy Intelligence, down from some 5.91 million b/d in February. The schedule ofmaintenance outages doubled over the month as more refineries shut down primary processing units to avert anoversupply. Large refineries that crank out heavy fuel oil, such as Rosneftâ€™s Tuapse, and smaller facilities witha slate of semi-finished products were among the sudden closures. April maintenance could take some 950,000 b/doff line, according to estimates, and analysts believe outages during the month will surpass those in March. In total,throughput could dip beneath 5 million b/d, the lowest since April 2013 excluding the pandemic-related declineposted in May 2020. Motor Fuel Focus Given export restrictions, domestic consumption patterns, and the system ofcompensation, only refineries producing fuel-grade gasoline and diesel can turn a decent margin. With Russiaisolated from a large swathe of the international aviation market, jet fuel has ceased to be an attractive part of theslate, while heavy fuel oil, or mazut, is now incurring such enormous losses that refineries with minimal or noconversion capacity are better off switching primary distillation units to hot-circulation mode and waiting for bettertimes. Russia typically exports about 85% of its 750,000 b/d of mazut, and last year about half of this was shippedto the US. But now that Washington has banned such imports, refineries are stuck with the unwanted volumes. As aresult, mazut inventories soared in March and prices collapsed. By Apr. 4, one metric ton of heavy fuel oil on the St.Petersburg commodities exchange was 19,100 rubles ($225), or $35 per barrel. On Mar. 31, the margin for sellingone ton of mazut domestically â€ which factors in the local crude cost and value-added tax â€ was a negative$71/bbl. Little wonder then that oil companies have begun announcing unplanned outages. By contrast, the cracksfor gasoline and diesel have been stellar thanks to the so-called buffer mechanism, part of a formula forcompensating refiners for selling motor fuels at home, where prices tend to be significantly less than the exportnetback. A weak ruble has greatly skewed the formula to refinersâ€™ favor. The gasoline crack for a typical refinerin the European part of Russia was 29,000 rubles per ton, or $40/bbl, as of Apr. 1. The equivalent crack for summerdiesel was a staggering 43,400 rubles/ton, or $68/bbl, thanks to climbing diesel prices to Europe now that thecontinent is shunning Russian imports. Oil companies tapped their gasoline and diesel inventories to capitalize onthe attractive margins, which are expected to decline in April due to a firmer ruble and possible amendments to thetax system.Gary Peach"
Apr 2022;"Don't let a drop of even blended Russian oil into UK, says Ukraine";"UKRAINE'S government has urged the UK to ensure ""not a single drop of Russian oil enters the country"", as itpushed for a ""total and immediate"" boycott on Russian fossil fuels.Oleg Ustenko, economic adviser to Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, said it was ""no time for half measures"" amidconcerns Britain may adopt a definition of Russian oil that allows some Kremlin supplies into the country.The UK government is banning Russian oil imports to avoid aiding Vladimir Putin's war effort, giving UK buyers untilthe end of the year to adapt before the policy comes into force.Whitehall says it is still working with industry to ""develop a clear definition of what constitutes Russian oil,"" raisingconcerns that products containing some molecules from the country's produce might still be allowed through.Diesel and other refined oil products can contain a mix of supplies from several countries under long-standingindustry practice or because they have been stored in mixed tanks.There are also concerns that oil from Russia is increasingly being mixed with supplies from other countries toobscure its origin, as traders try to keep energy supplies flowing while avoiding criticism for aiding the Kremlin.Mr Ustenko said: ""We would welcome the UK engaging with Ukraine on how they define Russian oil - after all it'sour people being killed with the proceeds. For us, every drop of Russian oil is Blood Oil. For the UK to really standalongside Ukrainians, we need to see a total - and immediate - boycott on Russian fossil fuels.""Russia will always seek to find loopholes in whatever sanctions and policies the UK puts in place. This is no timefor half measures.""The only way to avoid customers in Britain inadvertently helping Putin is to ensure not a drop of Russian oil entersthe country or is traded by UK-based companies."" Shell has pledged to withdraw from Russian oil products, butdefines refined versions, such as diesel, as not being of Russian origin if less than 50pc of the blend is from there.The UK typically gets about 8pc of its oil from Moscow, almost all in the form of refined products diesel and jet fuel.Disruption to diesel markets amid the war has forced up UK diesel prices to an average 176.11p as of yesterday.While Britain's embargo is impending, the EU is still debating whether to ban Russian oil imports amid concernsover the impact on its own economy. The UK and the EU have not yet banned imports of natural gas from Russia.The UK gets less than 4pc of its gas directly from Russia but is connected to EU markets which are heavily reliant.Gas was flowing normally to Europe via Ukraine as of yesterday, Gazprom said.Dominic Kavakeb, senior adviser at the campaign group Global Witness, said: ""Every drop of oil we import fromRussia is of direct benefit to Putin's barbaric crimes against Ukraine.""What is needed has been obvious since even before Ukraine was invaded; a full embargo on Russian oil -including blended oil - and gas.""50pc Shell defines refined oil products, such as diesel, as not being of Russian origin if less than half the blend isfrom there"
Apr 2022;"Global economy to 'slow significantly' - IMF";"Sri Lanka, April 26 -- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that the global economic recovery will ""slowsignificantly"" this year due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The IMF not only downgraded growth prospects in Eastern European countries, but warned that countries aroundthe world will be affected by the disruption to commodities markets as a result of the war.The international body now expects global GDP, a measure of economic growth, to rise 3.6% in 2022 (adowngrade from January's projection of 4.4%) and another 3.6% in 2023 (also a downgrade from the last projectionof 3.8%).""This crisis unfolds while the global economy was on a mending path but had not yet fully recovered from theCOVID-19 pandemic,"" said IMF Economic Counsellor Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.Russia saw the largest downgrade in the IMF report, with the country's economy now expected to contract by 8.5%this year (compared to the 2.8% growth it had projected prior to the invasion).Western sanctions on the country have cut off trade in and out of Russia, and other measures have largelydisconnected the Russian central bank and private banks from the global financial system.But the global economy is likely to feel the ripple effects of higher prices due to Russia's importance as energyand metals exporter to the global economy, alongside Ukraine's normal contribution of wheat and corn. The IMFsays supply disruptions in both countries will likely exacerbate the already high inflation being observed in countrieslike the United States.""Even prior to the war, inflation had surged in many economies because of soaring commodity prices andpandemic-induced supply-demand imbalances,"" Gourinchas noted.The IMF also called attention to the lingering risk of COVID-related disruptions. China's strict zero-COVID policyhas led to lockdowns in major economic hubs like Shanghai, leading the IMF to downgrade growth prospects forthe world's second largest economy to 4.4% this year.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Apr 2022;"Global economic forecasts are dropping fast";" Theworld economy has entered a period of intense uncertainty, as a capricious pandemic and the fallout fromRussia's war in Ukraine are fuelling inflation and weighing on an already fragile global recovery. These collidingchallenges are confronting policymakers and central bankers in the United States and Europe as they seek to bringdown inflation without slowing growth so much that their economies tip into recession. In the last week,international organisations and think-tanks have begun slashing their forecasts for growth and trade as they assessthe war's disruptions to global energy, food and commodity supplies, as well asChina'ssweeping lockdowns tocontain a renewed coronavirus outbreak. The pall overtheworld economy was underscored on Tuesday by theInternational Monetary Fund, which said in its World Economic Outlook that global output was expected to slowthis year to 3.6%, from 6.1% in 2021. That is a downgrade from a January forecast of 4.4% growth this year.'Global economic prospects have been severely set back, largely because ofRussia'swar on Ukraine'', Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, said at a press briefing on Tuesday. 'This crisisunfolds asthe globaleconomy has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic.'The economic concerns are a central topic forpolicymakers convening in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. Themeetings will provide an opportunity for the United States to show solidarity with Ukrainian officials who will be inattendance and to demonstrate that Russia will remain isolated on the international stage as long as its invasioncontinues. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to attend an opening session on Wednesday that will includeUkraine's finance minister, as the US looks to stand with allies in opposition of Russia's war, a Treasury official said.Yellen will not attend some G-20 sessions, such as those on international financial architecture and sustainablefinance, if Russians are participating. The impact of Russia's war on the global economy will dominate themeetings. Gourinchas said the war was slowing growth and spurring inflation, which he described as a 'clear andpresent danger' for many countries. He added that disruptions to Russian supplies of oil, gas and metals, along withUkrainian exports of wheat and corn, will ripple through commodities markets and across the global economy 'likeseismic waves.' He acknowledged that the trajectory of the global economy would depend on how the warproceeded and the ultimate breadth of the sanctions that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asiaimposed on Russia. 'Uncertainty around these projections is considerable, well beyond the usual range'',Gourinchas said. 'Growth could slow down further, while inflation could exceed our projections if, for instance,sanctions extend to Russian energy exports.' Ukraineand Russiaarefacing the most dire economic consequencesfrom the war. The IMF expects the Ukrainian economy to contract by 35% this year, while Russia's economy isprojected to shrink by 8.5%. Gourinchas noted that Russian authorities have so far managed to contain a collapseof its financial system and avoided bank failures but that further sanctions targeting its energy industry could havean even more significant impact on its economy. Russian sanctions imposed by America and its allies are the mainfactor contributing to the downward revision of the IMF's global growth outlook, Gourinchas said, adding that atightening of restrictions that targets Russian energy exports would represent an 'adverse scenario' that wouldfurther slow output around the world. Rising prices around the world show no signs of abating, the IMF said, even ifsupply chain problems ease. It expects inflation to remain elevated throughout the year, projecting it at 5.7% inadvanced economies and 8.7% in emerging markets. Other organisations and research groups have also paredback their forecasts. At the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington thinktank, economistsexpect global growth to decline from a rapid 5.8% in 2021 to 3.3% annually in 2022 and 2023."
Apr 2022;"Global economic recovery stalled by Ukraine war";"Jakarta, April 13 -- Finance Minister, concurrently Chair of the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK), SriMulyani Indrawati, stated that global economic recovery was stalled due to the conflict between Russia andUkraine.""Improvement in the global economy itself will be lower than the previous projections,"" the minister noted at theKSSK Press Conference here on Wednesday.Sri Mulyani explained that improvement in the global economy will be lower as compared to the earlier projectionsaccompanied by increased financial market volatility in line with the escalation of the war between the twocountries.Earlier, positive expectations for the global economic recovery in line with the easing of COVID-19 becamerestrained or came under pressure due to escalation of the war in Ukraine since February 24, 2022.The imposition of sanctions by the United States, Europe, and G7 countries against Russia in the midst of ongoingsupply chain disruptions had also depressed the trade volume and prospects for global economic growth.The war also triggered a very significant increase in global commodity prices, especially energy, food, and metalcommodities and resulted in an increase in global inflation.The war between Russia and Ukraine also creates challenges for the normalization of the monetary policy indeveloped countries that then raises uncertainty in global financial markets.Capital flows in emerging markets were also depressed due to the monetary policies of developed countries inresponse to the surge in inflation, which at the same time was still facing the potential for an economic downturn.""This is in line with the asset reallocation step to find a safe haven asset,"" she stated.On the other hand, Sri Mulyani emphasized that the stability of the Indonesian financial system was still normal,indicated by stable economic recovery, especially supported by the better handling of COVID-19.The decline in cases and good handling of COVID-19, followed by the easing of restrictions on community activities,in the end further encouraged domestic economic activities.Indonesia's economic growth is also forecast to remain strong, supported by public or household consumptionactivities, investment activities, and support for government spending.However, Sri Mulyani did not deny that there were several other risks from global conditions that would likely affectinflation, cost of funds, and domestic economic performance.Hence, the KSSK will continue to strengthen coordination, including in formulating policy responses that arecoordinated and synergized in maintaining national economic recovery from global turmoil and dynamics.""The KSSK remains vigilant and monitors financial system stability in order to maintain it,"" the minister noted.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Antara News.

In the last week, international organizations and think tanks have begun slashing their forecasts for growth andtrade as they assess the war's disruptions to global energy, food and commodity supplies, as well as China'ssweeping lockdowns to contain a renewed coronavirus outbreak. The pall over the world economy was underscored on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund, which said inits World Economic Outlook that global output was expected to slow this year to 3.6 percent, from 6.1 percent in2021. That is a downgrade from a January forecast of 4.4 percent growth this year. ''Global economic prospects have been severely set back, largely because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,''Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the I.M.F.'s chief economist, said at a news briefing on Tuesday. ''This crisis unfolds asthe global economy has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic.'' The impact of Russia's war on the global economy will be a central topic for policymakers convening inWashington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. As the meetings got underway, policymakers grappled with how to maintain pressure on Russia while keeping theeconomic recovery on track and protecting the world's poor from rising prices. While some countries that exportcommodities will benefit from a period of higher fuel and food prices, for most economies the disruptions weighheavily. ''The war has made an already dire situation worse,'' Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a speech aboutrising food insecurity on Tuesday. ''Price and supply shocks are already materializing, adding to global inflationarypressures, creating risks to external balances, and undermining the recovery from the pandemic.'' On Wednesday, Ms. Yellen plans to attend an opening session that will include Ukraine's finance minister as theUnited States looks to stand with allies in opposition to Russia's invasion, a Treasury official said. However, Ms.Yellen will not attend some Group of 20 sessions, such as those on international financial architecture andsustainable finance, if Russians are participating. Against that backdrop, the I.M.F.'s new data revealed a daunting set of economic headwinds. Mr. Gourinchassaid the war was slowing growth and spurring inflation, which he described as a ''clear and present danger'' formany countries. He added that disruptions to Russian supplies of oil, gas and metals, along with Ukrainian exportsof wheat and corn, will ripple through commodities markets and across the global economy ''like seismic waves.'' He acknowledged that the trajectory of the global economy would depend on how the war proceeded and theultimate breadth of the sanctions that the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia imposed on Russia. ''Uncertainty around these projections is considerable, well beyond the usual range,'' Mr. Gourinchas said.''Growth could slow down further while inflation could exceed our projections if, for instance, sanctions extend toRussian energy exports.'' Ukraine and Russia are facing the most dire economic consequences from the war. The I.M.F. expects theUkrainian economy to contract by 35 percent this year, while Russia's economy is projected to shrink 8.5 percent.Mr. Gourinchas noted that the Russian authorities had so far managed to prevent a collapse of their financialsystem and avoided bank failures but said further sanctions targeting Russia's energy industry could have asignificant impact on its economy. The sweeping sanctions that America and its allies have already imposed on Russia are the main factorcontributing to the downward revision of the I.M.F.'s global growth outlook, Mr. Gourinchas said. He added that atightening of restrictions on Russian energy exports would be an ''adverse scenario'' that would further slow outputaround the world. Rising prices around the world show no signs of abating, the I.M.F. said, even if supply chain problems ease. Itexpects inflation to remain elevated throughout the year, projecting it at 5.7 percent in advanced economies and8.7 percent in emerging markets. Inflation hit 8.5 percent in the United States last month, the fastest 12-month pacesince 1981. Other international organizations and research groups have also pared back their global growth forecasts.Economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, expect global growth todecline from a rapid 5.8 percent in 2021 to 3.3 percent annually in 2022 and 2023. The World Bank also expressed alarm this week about the state of the global economy, warning that thelingering pandemic, Covid-19 lockdowns in China and higher inflation could amplify income inequality and povertyrates. It lowered its 2022 growth forecast to 3.2 percent from 4.1 percent. ''I'm deeply concerned about developing countries,'' David Malpass, the World Bank president, said on Monday.''They're facing sudden price increases for energy, fertilizer and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases.Each one hits them hard.'' According to the Bank for International Settlements, more than half of emerging economies have inflation ratesabove 7 percent. And 60 percent of ''advanced economies,'' including the United States and the euro area, haveinflation over 5 percent, the largest share since the 1980s, the bank said. In Britain, inflation climbed to 7 percent in March, the highest level in 30 years. An April 12 survey of global investors by BofA Securities found that more than two-thirds were pessimistic aboutglobal growth prospects in the months ahead. Several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, are trying to tame rapid inflation by raising interest rates andremoving other pandemic-era economic support. Whether policymakers can succeed in taking the heat out of theeconomy without triggering a recession remains to be seen. Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Board, saidthat underlying demand in the United States remained strong, because of the savings accumulated by consumersduring the pandemic and their pent-up desire for spending. ''Demand will be and will need to be restrained by the removal of monetary accommodation,'' she said. ''And thishas become very clear in recent months.'' In addition to the war, the pandemic and rising interest rates, China is facing a downturn in its property sector, andthe Brazilian economy could be damaged by political turmoil related to coming elections, she said. New data show that Chinese economic growth and retail sales are flagging, as the government imposessweeping lockdowns to stamp out the coronavirus. By April 11, 87 of China's 100 largest cities had imposed someform of restriction on movement, according to Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm. The restrictions are again disrupting global supply chains for electronics, car parts and other goods, anddampening Chinese imports of oil, food and consumer goods. China is the world's largest oil importer, and coolingdemand there caused the International Energy Agency last week to trim its forecasts for oil demand growth thisyear to 1.9 million barrels a day, from an increase of 5.6 million barrels a day last year. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions imposed to punish Moscow, also threaten to tip Europeaneconomies into recession. Last week, forecasters at Germany's top economic institutes projected that a fullEuropean ban on Russian energy imports would cause German output to contract 2.2 percent next year and pushinflation up to 7.3 percent, a record for postwar Germany. Global trade growth is also expected to slow this year. The World Trade Organization expects world merchandisetrade volumes to expand 3 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4.7 percent. But depending on howthe pandemic and the war unfold, trade growth could be as low as 0.5 percent or as high as 5.5 percent, NgoziOkonjo-Iweala, the organization's director general, said in a news conference last Tuesday. The group forecast that global trade growth would rebound to 3.4 percent next year, though those estimates arealso subject to change. Dr. Okonjo-Iweala said the war prevented the organization's economists from gathering key data on economicoutput, forcing them to rely on in-house simulations of how sanctions on Russian, the devastation of Ukrainianinfrastructure, and the broader erosion of business and consumer confidence would affect global growth, she said. ''The economic reverberations of this conflict will extend far beyond Ukraine's borders,'' she said. ''It is now clearthat the double whammy of the pandemic and the war has disrupted supply chains, increased inflationarypressures, and lowered expectations for output and trade growth.''https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/business/economy/imf-world-economy-inflation.htmlGraphicPHOTO: Ukrainian refugees waited to sign up for temporary residence permits in Brussels.

Apr 2022;"Global economy under increased stress";"The economic damage from the Russian-Ukrainian military conflict is expected to grow in terms of the slowdown ofthe global economy. The conflict has transmission impacts through international trade, financial channels andcommodity markets. Inflation, already high before the conflict, has become a serious problem, driven primarily byincreases in energy, grain and food prices.The IMF, in its January revision of its projections, estimated world growth of 4.4% in 2022 and 3.8% in 2023. Now,in April, the expected expansion in 2022 drops to 3.6% and to the same rate for 2023. The agency acknowledgesthat these estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty: there is no guarantee that the pandemic will not re-emerge with some force, and the assumption is to keep the conflict confined to the Ukraine area. A geographicspread of the war could have devastating impacts. Even with these caveats, it is discouraging that the IMF projectsthat, with a few exceptions in the world, most countries would maintain employment and output below pre-pandemiclevels until 2026.The IMF now projects inflation of 5.7% for advanced economies and 8.7% for emerging and developingeconomies, when in January it expected 3.9% and 5.9% respectively. This is a severe deterioration.Many countries, both developed and emerging, used their existing fiscal spaces to mitigate the effect of therecession caused by the pandemic in 2020 and part of 2021. The United States, with its policy of handing outchecks directly to families, was certainly noteworthy. Now, just when it seemed that the shock of the pandemic wasbeing overcome, the geopolitical conflict has unexpectedly arisen. Most countries no longer have the possibility offiscal buffers to absorb the effects of the economic slowdown. With the acute resurgence of inflation, for many therelative weight of responsibility for macroeconomic adjustment has shifted from governments (fiscal policy) to themonetary policy of central banks.In this environment, macroeconomic policy faces serious dilemmas: balancing inflation control with safeguardingthe recovery that requires the difficult task of rebuilding fiscal space without further indebtedness. In the order ofpriorities, it seems to me that it is now the turn of central banks' responsibility, since their success in bringing downinflation depends on preserving their credibility.A global cycle of interest rate hikes is inevitable, recognizing that several, including the Federal Reserve, arealready late in this process of hikes, trying to correct past mistakes for not having acted in a more timely manner.The gravity of this outlook is that this environment of low growth and high inflation will prevail in 2023. This wouldcomplete a four-year period that could well qualify as global stagflation.federico@rubli.net"
May 2022;"Air travel to become costlier, as jet fuel prices rise again";"Dhaka, May 21 -- Air travel is being costlier again, as the jet fuel prices have hiked again in the country. Increasingof price by Tk 6, the jet fuel price reaches Tk106 as Padma Oil Company, a subsidiary of Bangladesh PetroleumCorporation (BPC), did it.Aviation sources said that the fuel constitutes around 40pc of the total running cost of an airline. As a result, the airtravel will unavoidably become more costly. Sources from Aviation industry said that the decision would tremble thedomestic aviation sector.""Until the government takes initiatives to reduce jet fuel prices or gives necessary subsidies, the industry musthave to face a dire consequence,"" an official from a privately operated airlines said.He said that the prices of jet fuel have so far been hiked 15 times in the past 18 months which the industry insidersconsidering an acute burden in their business.Sources from the BPC said that the jet fuel prices was reviewed in every month, based on the average price of theinternational benchmark.Besides, it depends on especially the neighbouring Indian jet fuel market, said one of the officials. They said thatthe new price list of jet fuel was updated on May 14 and was in effect since May 15.As per the BPC sources, jet fuel costs Tk106 per litre for domestic flights and the international price of jet fuelstands at USD 1.09 per litre. It was USD 1.02 per litre in April.Members of Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) complained that BPC had beenfrequently raising fuel prices solely by citing the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war.Officials from privately operated US-Bangla and NOVOAIR and public carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines said thatjet fuel prices had risen by more than 130pc in the last year and a half which make their business tougher.They said it was a big blow to the aviation industry in the country, and passengers would have to pay the ultimateprice.Kamrul Islam, General Manager of public relations at US-Bangla Airlines, said, ""If the government fails to control jetfuel prices, domestic airlines will suffer financially and lose their position in the aviation market.""Meanwhile, Lal Hossain, BPC Secretary, said, ""The committee responsible for fuel prices has hiked the price of jetfuel, citing high import costs as the government offers no subsidies for jet fuel. In comparison to the Indian market,the jet fuel price here is not high.""Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

May 2022;"Is the global economy heading for recession?";"If Leo Tolstoy were writing about today’s business conditions, he might have noted that happy economies are allalike but every unhappy economy is unhappy in its own way.China’s growth prospects have been hammered by strict Covid-19 lockdowns in a bid to quell its Omicron outbreak;the US Federal Reserve risks turning an American boom into bust; Europe’s households are enduring a cost ofliving crisis; and the situation is worse in many poorer emerging markets, where food crises and even faminesbeckon.These four different but imposing problems each stalk the global economy as it recovers from the pandemic and itis not surprising the mood is darkening.According to Robin Brooks, chief economist of the Institute of International Finance, the confluence of these shockssuggests the world economy is already in trouble. “We’re in another global recession scare now, except this timewe think it’s for real,” he says.Financial markets have taken fright. The MSCI world index of equities fell more than 1.5 per cent in the past week,more than 5 per cent in May and more than 18 per cent since a peak in early January. Dhaval Joshi, chief strategistat BCA Research, notes that on top of a torrid time for stocks, there has been a sell-off in bonds, inflation-protectedbonds, industrial metals, gold and crypto assets.“The last time that the ‘everything sell-off’ star alignment happened was in early 1981 when Paul Volcker’s Fedbroke the back of inflation and turned stagflation into an outright recession,” Joshi says.Defining a global recession is no easy task. For individual countries, some economists define a “technicalrecession” as two consecutive quarters of contraction in gross domestic product. The Financial Times prefers amore flexible definition as does the US, where the National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as“a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a fewmonths”.?At a global scale definitions become still more difficult. The IMF and World Bank prefer to characterise a globalrecession as a year in which the average global citizen experiences a drop in real income. They highlight 1975,1982, 1991, 2009 and 2020 as the dates of the previous five global recessions.While the official global growth forecasts for 2022 still seem far off this definition — in April the IMF expectedannual growth of 3.6 per cent this year — this figure relates as much to the recovery in the second half of 2021 asto expectations for 2022. When the fund looks at the growth it expects during 2022, it has already cut its forecastfrom 4.5 per cent in October last year to 2.5 per cent in April.Brooks reckons that the news since this forecast was published has been sufficiently bad to lower the growthprojection to just 0.5 per cent during 2022, less than the expected increase in population. “Mounting globalrecession risk is top-of-mind for markets, which has important repercussions for investor psychology,” Brooks says.China is the big economy that most economists are worried about and the past week has seen new datareinforcing concerns about its prospects. Accounting for 19 per cent of the world’s total output, China is now solarge that when it catches Covid the rest of the world cannot ignore its pain, especially because of its impact onglobal supply chains and its demand for goods and services from other countries.Severe strains are showing. With lockdowns rippling through the country, ships queue outside Chinese ports andthe country’s manufacturing and retail sectors have started to contract. Retail sales fell 11 per cent year on year inApril, while industrial production was down 3 per cent. China’s home sales also dropped more last month than inearly 2020, when its economy went into reverse, despite the People’s Bank of China loosening monetary policy toencourage borrowing and spending. Unemployment is rising.Kevin Xie, senior Asia economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, says that China’s economic data in Aprilwas consistently disappointing. Although the outlook depends crucially on the spread of Covid, he adds, “fallingemployment and weakened confidence among business and households will curb spending and bode poorly for thegrowth outlook”.In the US, the other global economic powerhouse, the economy is suffering from the pandemic’s legacy and, inparticular, excessive fiscal stimulus that arguably ran the economy too hot and generated high inflation even withmodest energy price rises. Alongside a very tight labour market, the Fed has been forced to concede an error andhas now moved decisively into a phase of tightening monetary policy to slow growth and bring inflation down.The Fed chair Jay Powell was crystal clear this week that the central bank would continue raising interest rates untilit saw “clear and convincing” evidence that inflation was returning to the 2 per cent target. He was not concernedabout unemployment rising “a few ticks” from the current low level of 3.6 per cent.Powell added that he was aiming at a soft landing for the economy, but many in financial markets think that mightbe hard to achieve. Krishna Guha, vice-chair of Evercore ISI, warns there is a much higher than normal risk that thetough talk from officials, economists and market participants would become a self-fulfilling prophecy and generate adownturn.“To say a softish landing is possible is not to say it is inevitable or even particularly likely,” Guha says. Although heis not predicting a US recession, Guha says, “bringing inflation under control without a recession and large increasein unemployment . . . will be challenging”.On the other side of the Atlantic, Europe’s equally difficult problem is different. Apart from the UK, inflation stemsalmost universally from higher energy prices rather than an overheating economy and can be traced directly toRussia’s invasion of Ukraine.Unfortunately for the EU, understanding the cause of Europe’s woes does not diminish its consequences. Withinflation of 7.4 per cent in April, eurozone prices are rising much faster than its citizen’s incomes, imparting a hit toliving standards that will limit spending and the recovery from the pandemic. New forecasts from the EuropeanCommission this week were scaled back sharply and implied stagnation in the second quarter of 2022.?The commission expects the economy to get over this difficult period and return to reasonable growth of about halfa per cent per quarter by the summer, but many private sector economists think the hit to incomes will have longer-lasting effects. Christian Schulz, an economist at Citi, says that the official forecasts appear too optimistic and it ismore likely there will be “virtually no growth for the rest of the year”.If Europe’s difficulty is in adjusting to much higher energy prices, poorer countries have the even harder task ofdealing with the rapid rise in the price of food, which account for more than 30 per cent of expenditure in emergingeconomies.With the Black Sea ports that Ukraine uses for exporting grains shut, fears of a food crisis later this year aremounting. António Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, said on Wednesday that the conflict in Ukraine, comingon top of existing pressures on food prices, “threatens to tip tens of millions of people over the edge into foodinsecurity followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine”.Although it has its own domestic political and economic crises, Sri Lanka epitomises the dire choices faced inmany of the world’s poorest countries when it decided this week to default on its foreign debt for the first time. This,it said, was necessary to use its hard currency for importing fuel, food and medicine.India, meanwhile, intensified the problems in other emerging economies by reneging on a pledge not to ban theexport of grain this week. Wheat prices rose again and are up more than 60 per cent this year.Naturally, as recession risks rise, the best news for the global economy would be a Russian withdrawal fromUkraine and an end to the zero-Covid strategy in China. This is not in the gift of economic ministers and officials,so instead, they will again have to fine tune their response to the difficult situations they face.In Europe and emerging economies, this will involve alleviating the consequences of higher food and energy prices— raising benefits and subsidising food and energy in countries with sufficiently strong public finances. The US andUK could accelerate the tightening cycle of monetary policy, while China will seek to limit the negative effects of theOmicron coronavirus wave in China.The majority view among economists is that the defence against global recession will still win in 2022. Buteconomists are increasingly hedging their bets in the face of relentless bad news.Innes McFee, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, says there is little question that the global economicexpansion is close to a peak, that it is slowing and that policymakers will need to work out how much tightening isneeded. But, he says, a recession is still unlikely for now because policymakers still have the tools to back awayand stimulate if things get worse.“Recession risks rise into next year, but they are not that high at this time,” McFee says.Letters in response to this article:The last thing America’s economy needs right now / From Desmond Lachman, American Enterprise Institute,Washington, DC, USWhy inflation is a chance to drive energy transition / From Natalie Chapman, Cambridge Judge Business School,University of Cambridge, UK"
May 2022;"East Coast jet fuel prices remain higher than other spot price hubs";"Washington: U.S Energy Information Administration has issued the following news release:The spot jet fuel price in New York Harbor traded at record-high levels for several weeks in April. The price hassince declined, but it has remained higher than the prices at both the U.S Gulf Coast and the Amsterdam,Rotterdam, and Antwerp (ARA) trading hubs. The high jet fuel prices coincide with record-low jet fuel inventorylevels on the East Coast and rising demand for air travel. A confluence of supply and demand factors hascontributed to increased price volatility in the East Coast jet fuel market.Reduced consumption of most petroleum products after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 affectedrefinery operations; these changes focused on maximizing yields of distillate fuel oil, whose consumptiondecreasedcomparatively lessthan gasoline and jet fuel during the pandemic. As refineries shifted yields to produce moredistillate fuel oil, jet fuel production from refiners in both the U.S Gulf Coast and East Coast regions hasremainedrelatively low.East Coast jet fuel inventories declined to 6.5 million barrels the week ending April 8, 2022, the lowest foranyweeksince 1990, when we began reporting weekly jet fuel inventories by region. This decline began in the middleof 2021 asjet fuel demand increased. Increasing consumption and relatively low refinery and blender production ofjet fuel have contributed to low inventories on the East Coast sincelate 2021.Although most of the East Coast ’ s jet fuel supply is shipped by pipeline from refineries in the U.S Gulf Coastregion, the East Coast has also increased its jet fuel imports as well as shipments by tanker and barge from theU.S Gulf Coast in the past two years. Imports and tanker and barge shipments are more expensive methods ofdelivery than pipeline shipments, suggesting that East Coast purchasers are using shorter-term spot transactionsfor supply.Beyond the pandemic-related disruptions to petroleum product supply and demand, the East Coast ’ s loss of the335,000 barrels per day (b/d) Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery, whichclosed after an explosion in mid-2019,has affected refinery output of all petroleum products in the region, including jet fuel. Based on average East Coastjet fuel yields and refinery utilization, we estimate the refinery produced 20,000 b/d of jet fuel, a volume equivalentto about 20% of total East Coast jet fuel production before the COVID-19 pandemic.Principal contributors:Jeff Barron, Kevin Hack"
May 2022;"European Snapshot: Supply Constraints Tighten Jet Market";"Supply-side constraints made European jet fuel markets especially vulnerable when Russia invaded Ukraine inlate February. Tanks were 25% lower than year-earlier rates at some 8.7 million tons in February. Stocks in Spainhad the largest 42% deficit while UK tanks were off by 36%. But regional demand had rebounded to 84% above theyear-earlier mark as more countries lifted travel restrictions. European refiners ramped up jet output to 2.5 milliontons in February to capture strong margins for middle distillates. Refiners maximized jet fuel and diesel output tokeep yields at more than 50% despite lower downstream utilization rates. A steep drop in lifeblood jet fuel importsto unusually low levels below 1.8 million tons in February tightened up regional supplies and amplified the impact ofRussian export disruptions in March.

May 2022;"US Diesel Exports Add to East Coast Refueling Woes";"Airlines refueling at airports on the East Coast are heading into summer facing huge challenges from sky-high jetfuel prices and possible supply shortages. A surge in US diesel export flows to offset Russian volumes comes ontop of stronger jet demand and lower structural supply out of regional refineries, as well as insufficient pipelinedeliveries. That perfect storm has upended East Coast refined product markets and sent middle distillate pricesand margins into the stratosphere. Against a backdrop of looming market shortages, lower jet fuel allocationsthrough pipelines create operational headaches as airlines ramp up capacity to pre-pandemic levels.Pipeline supplies into the East Coast and other parts of the country are restricted due to reduced jet fuel shipmentsin the wake of the pandemic. Allocations are based on previous shipping history, which was erased as jet fueldemand plummeted in 2020. The loss of line history for jet fuel shippers means that allocations are falling wellshort of rising demand. Jet fuel is now crowded out by gasoline and diesel shipments, which have continued togrow over the last two years. US airline and airport groups as well as the International Air Transport Associationhave joined forces to address the problem. In comments sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aboutoil pipeline allocation issues, they have requested a reset so that jet fuel shippers can recoup their previousvolumes. Their lengthy document points out that fuel supply problems last summer disrupted operations atnumerous airports across the country. Airlines were forced to tanker in supplies, look for scarce truck deliveries,reduce passenger and cargo payloads and add fuel stops. The situation could worsen this summer as airlinesrestore capacity. Trans-Atlantic Reset Alongside logistical constraints, rising diesel exports out of the US havemagnified the spike in jet fuel prices as the dire situation in Europe siphons diesel across the Atlantic. Shortages inEurope have rearranged Atlantic Basin product trade flows, with US refiners likely to emerge as major winners.â€œThe United States has become the marginal supplier of an export barrel in the wake of cutbacks in Russianproduction and the inability of Russia to supply markets,â€ noted PBF Energy CEO Tom Nimbley during thecompany's recent first-quarter earnings call. Data from both the US Census Bureau and tanker-tracking firm Kplershow significant increases in US diesel shipments to Europe. The data suggest total movements of clean productsto Europe from the US averaged 203,000 barrels per day in April, up from 139,000 b/d in the same month last year.While US flows to Europe rise, those going in the other direction are dwindling. Kpler data show April clean productimports from Europe dropped by more than 300,000 b/d year on year, and current projected May shipments aredown over 50% from 2021. New York Supply Gap The need to ship more product abroad to offset Russian lossespushed US Northeast spot diesel prices in April above $5.35 per gallon, with exports diverting volumes typicallyshipped from the Gulf Coast to Padd 1 on the Colonial Pipeline. Soaring diesel prices have lit a fire under EastCoast jet fuel markets, which now rely on pipeline deliveries to meet 80% of their needs. Padd 1 production hasfallen to 76,000 b/d this year, 23% down from 98,000 b/d in 2019 due in part to the closure of a Philadelphiarefinery, according to government data. Imports have plummeted 40% to 32,000 b/d from 53,000 b/d, while demandhas climbed back to 528,000 b/d â€ within reach of its 576,000 b/d rate in 2019. Despite soaring diesel prices inNew York Harbor, product flows into the region have not increased. Experts and market players point to a murkysituation that can make higher outright New York Harbor prices misleading. Shipping product to Europe via tankercan take less time than piping it from the Gulf Coast to the US Northeast. The Jones Act â€ which requiresdomestic maritime trade in the US to take place on vessels crewed and constructed by US citizens and entities â€makes domestic shipping via tanker more expensive as well. Meanwhile, the forward prices for diesel tend to dropmore precipitously in the US than they do in Europe. Those two dynamics inform where refiners choose to sell,especially as contract expiry approaches. Steep backwardation in the forward curve for diesel â€ with promptsupplies at a huge premium to future values â€ can make exports a more profitable option than shipping up theColonial Pipeline from the Gulf Coast.Frans Koster, Cristina Haus"

May 2022;"A Resilient Global Economy Is Within Reach";" May 12 -- War rages in Ukraine and a global crisis looms. Gas prices rise and around the world, wheat, corn andfertilizer prices skyrocket. The International Monetary Fund says the global economy will slow, contributing to foodshortages in developing countries. Russia's war on Ukraine combined with Covid-19 made a terrible globalsituation worse. There are economic policies that Republican and Democratic leaders can find common groundwith the Biden administration to make the U.S. and global economy more resilient in the face of these threats.Before the war, the pandemic revealed the catastrophic consequences of persistent global poverty and inequalityfor everyone-not just the poor. In response, U.S. economic strategy must focus on transparency, democracy, andwhat Pope Francis calls ""a preferential option for the poor.""The Ukraine crisis shows what a difference U.S. leadership makes. As the world suffers impacts from the war andpandemic, our country can and must be the respected neighbor whom others look to in a crisis. We can bring othercountries together to help ensure our global future is peaceful, prosperous and democratic. Covid shows that publichealth is global-when some of us are vulnerable to the disease, we all are. The same is true of economicprosperity. With supply and economic shocks, U.S. prosperity depends on global prosperity.The U.S. should pursue four international economic objectives in response to the Ukraine war and the impacts ofthe pandemic.First, in this intense moment of global instability, we must maintain the basic financial health of developingcountries. We must ensure all countries' access to vaccines and protective gear. We must stop new coronavirusvariants from emerging in developing countries if we are to prevent new viruses that evade our vaccines and createnew economic shocks.Global economic stability also means having well-defined processes for international debt relief to help withstandcrises. This is an urgent need in Ukraine today. But despite agreements by world leaders, we continue to fail tohave a bankruptcy process at the country level. Adam Smith, the founder of classical economics, witnessed debt'sdevastating impact and urged the creation of a bankruptcy process for nations. Until we follow his advice, we willlack the tools to mitigate economic shocks and deal with crises in Ukraine and countries worldwide.Second, if we want a prosperous and stable global economy, we need policies that lift up working people, policiesbased on values as old as the Bible. The coronavirus crisis heightened inequality, destabilized supply chains, andled to workers working harder for less. We live in a global labor market, yet we lack rules for every worker to fairlyenjoy the fruits of their labor, to rest, be with family, and have time to recover from Covid and other illnesses.Stronger, more resilient supply chains and greater economic stability depend on eliminating huge differences inwages and family security worldwide. Then we can remove the temptation to exploit workers by any businessorganized enough to lease a shipping container.Third, financial markets and institutions have a part in stabilizing global society. But alone, they will not invest fastenough in needed technology to eliminate Covid-19 as a threat to the world economy or invest fast enough to stopclimate change from becoming an existential threat to human society. We need coordinated action amonggovernments to ensure there are sufficient investments globally to secure our common future.Finally, we need to end multilateral and individual country-level policies that wink at tax evasion and corruption bycorporations, oligarchs, and the wealthiest. Over the last 40 years, tax evasion became the norm, not alonebecause of rogue tax havens, but because the world's major economy governments were influenced by the superrich and corrupt. Russian oligarchs are not alone in wanting to enrich themselves while starving investment in local,national, and global communities.While we see progress on these policies in recent years in Congress, consecutive White Houses, and the IMF,G20, and G7, we need to move faster and with greater ambition to implement these policies.All around us we can see how important it is to have a global economic order that can withstand and moreimportantly act to prevent crises and provide good lives to those who do the world's work. If we fail to implementthese policies, the types of crises we have experienced in recent years, with their attendant failed supply chains andprice shocks, are likely to repeat and worsen, profoundly threatening America's prosperity and stability. But there isa better way. America can lead. We can emerge from this moment of crisis and realize the promise of a moreprosperous, democratic, and humane global society."

These price rises have undermined consumer confidenceand shaken the world's financial markets, prompting central banks including the US Federal Reserve to raiseinterest rates.Meanwhile, the repercussions on oil and food markets of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February and Covid-19lockdowns in China with no clear end have compounded the gloom.""We have at least four crises, which are interwoven.

Jun 2022;"Jet fuel price hike puts aviation industry in great crisis";"Dhaka, June 14 -- After being thrust into crisis by the Covid-19 pandemic, the country's aviation industry is nowfacing massive thrust for abnormal jet fuel price hike. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) has increased thefuel price to Tk 111 from Tk 48 per litre or 141 per cent in the last 19 months. The frequent enhancement of the jetfuel price may create a negative impact on the domestic aviation industry struggling to rebound from the shocks ofthe pandemic. Surprisingly, the cost of jet fuel for international flights remains unchanged.Local airlines operating domestic flights would suffer significant blows as a result of this jet fuel price hike. Thesector insiders said that passengers flying domestic would have to spend more money owing to the price hike.Padma Oil Company has raised jet fuel prices for the 15th time in 19 months. Last month, the price of jet fuel forboth international and local flights was raised by Tk 6 per litre. The price of jet fuel, which accounts for up to 46 percent of an airline's operational costs, was Tk 48 per litre in December 2020. Aviation Operators Association ofBangladesh (AOAB) said that there is no rationale for BPC's decision to raise jet fuel prices when the price of jetfuel in the world market remains stable. BPC is making a monopolistic choice to raise the price of aviation fuel andwe have nothing to say about it.Overall, the aviation sector is under pressure right now for a variety of reasons, including regular hikes in jet fuelprices, which account for 40 to 46 per cent of an airline's operational costs. If the ticket price increases, the aviationindustry will lose passengers. If the aviation business fails, the tourist and hospitality sectors, which employ 40 lakhpeople, will also suffer. To make the price go down, alternative and green fuel production need to ramp upsignificantly and new types of sustainable aviation fuel must come to the market.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Jun 2022;"COVID-19, Ukraine war slow global economy - World Bank";" Abuja June 7, 2022 The World Bank says the damage from Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the war in Ukraine haveintensified the slowdown in the global economy, leading to a period of weak growth and increased inflation.This is contained in a statement released on the World Bank website on Tuesday on the bank's latest GlobalEconomic Prospects Report.According to the report, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic is the Russian invasion of Ukraine which it said hadmagnified the slowdown in the global economy, leading to a protracted period of feeble growth and elevatedinflation.'This raises the risk of stagflation, with potentially harmful consequences for middle- and low-income economiesalike,' it said.Naija247news reports that according to Business Insider, Stagflation is an economic condition that is caused by acombination of slow economic growth, high unemployment and rising prices.The bank said the report revealed that global growth was expected to slump from 5.7 per cent in 2021 to 2.9 percent in 2022, significantly lower than the 4.1 per cent that was anticipated in January.'It is expected to hover around that pace over 2023 to 2024, as the war in Ukraine disrupts activity, investment, andtrade in the near term, pent-up demand fades, and fiscal and monetary policy accommodation is withdrawn.'As a result of the damage from the pandemic and the war, the level of per capita income in developing economiesthis year will be nearly 5 per cent below its pre-pandemic trend,' it said.The statement quoted the World Bank's Group President, David Malpass, as saying 'The war in Ukraine, lockdownsin China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hampering growth.'Malpass said for many countries, a recession would be hard to avoid.'Markets look forward, so it is urgent to encourage production and avoid trade restrictions. Changes in fiscal,monetary, climate and debt policy are needed to counter capital misallocation and inequality,' he said.The statement said the June Global Economic Prospects report offers the first systematic assessment of howcurrent global economic conditions compare with the stagflation of the 1970s.It laid emphasis on how stagflation could affect emerging markets and developing economies.' The recovery from the stagflation of the 1970s required steep increases in interest rates in major advancedeconomies, which played a prominent role in triggering a string of financial crises in emerging markets anddeveloping economies,' it added.Ayhan Kose, Director, World Bank's Prospects Group, said 'developing economies will have to balance the need toensure fiscal sustainability with the need to mitigate the effects of today's overlapping crises on their poorestcitizens.'Communicating monetary policy decisions clearly, leveraging credible monetary policy frameworks, and protectingcentral bank independence can effectively anchor inflation expectations.'This will also reduce the amount of policy tightening required to achieve the desired effects on inflation and activity,'he said.The statement said the report also offered fresh insights into how the war's effects on energy markets wereclouding the global growth outlook.The report said the war in Ukraine had led to a surge in prices across a wide range of energy-related commodities.' Higher energy prices will lower real incomes, raise production costs, tighten financial conditions, and constrainmacroeconomic policy, especially in energy-importing countries,' it noted.The statement said the report highlighted the need for decisive global and national policy action to avert the worstconsequences of the war in Ukraine for the global economy.It said, 'This will involve global efforts to limit the harm to those affected by the war.'Global efforts to also cushion the blow from surging oil and food prices, to speed up debt relief, and to expandvaccinations in low-income countries.' It will also involve vigorous supply responses at the national level while keeping global commodity marketsfunctioning well.'It said policymakers also should refrain from distortionary policies such as price controls, subsidies and exportbans, which could worsen the recent increase in commodity prices.'Against the challenging backdrop of higher inflation, weaker growth, tighter financial conditions, and limited fiscalpolicy space, governments will need to reprioritise spending toward targeted relief for vulnerable populations.'"
Jun 2022;"Higher airfare looms as jet fuel prices soar";" The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) has revised the country's passenger fuel surcharge matrix and has introduceda fuel surcharge matrix for cargo following an evaluation in light of the continuous escalation of jet fuel prices in theglobal market.The CAB board, under Resolution No. 25, resolved to adopt new guidelines on passenger, as well as cargo fuelsurcharge for domestic and international flights.The CAB said a review of its earlier resolution showed that fuel surcharge was made only applicable topassengers, which is one component in a combination of service that involves passenger and cargo operations.Under the new guidelines, a cargo fuel surcharge has been provided with the CAB saying that the volatility of jetfuel prices also affect cargo operations as a component of combination service wherein cargo is carried in the belly-hold capacity of a passenger aircraft.The CAB said the cargo fuel surcharge shall be applicable only for cargo carried in the cargo hold in an aircraftused for combination services.Such cargo must be covered by an airway bill, it said.The CAB said the cargo fuel surcharge should be collected based on the actual weight carried per segment, and itshall not be levied against a passenger's check-in baggage.The cargo fuel surcharge matrix issued by the CAB has up to 20 levels for both domestic and international flights,with the rates amounting to as low as P0.19 per kilogram to as high as P9.94 per kg for domestic flights.For international flights originating from the Philippines, the rates ranges from as low as P0.64 per kg to a high ofP83.45 per kg, depending on the applicable fuel surcharge level for the given period.The CAB, meanwhile, has expanded passenger fuel surcharge matrix to up to Level 20 from the previousmaximum Level 7.Rates for the new passenger fuel surcharge matrix range from as low as P37 to as high as P1,933 for domesticflights, and a low of P123.57 to a high of P16,232.44 for international flights.The CAB said the passenger fuel surcharge level in effect on the day of ticketing will be applied and should be thesame for all passengers - adults, children and infants occupying seats.It said the applicable fuel surcharge shall be collected per passenger, per segment.The applicable fuel surcharge will be determined based on a one-month average of jet fuel MOPS (Mean of PlattsSingapore) prices in its peso per liter equivalent, and will be fixed for immediately succeeding month.For next month, the CAB, in an advisory, said passenger and cargo fuel surcharge for domestic and internationalflights would increase to Level 11 from Level 7 this month.'For May 10 to June 9, 2022, the price of jet fuel averaged P53.49 per liter, which corresponds to Level 11 of thepassenger and cargo fuel surcharge matrix,' the CAB said.Under the Level 11 of the new passenger fuel surcharge matrix, airlines are allowed to collect an increase fromP355 to P1,038 per passenger for domestic flights, and from P1,172.07 to P8,714.84 for international flights.As for the cargo fuel surcharge matrix, Level 11 is equivalent from P1.82 to P5.34 per kg for domestic flights, andfrom P6.03 to P44.80 per kg for international flights.Airlines are allowed to collect fuel surcharge rates that are lower than the stated level if they choose to do sodepending on how they want to compete with other carriers.The CAB said airline fuel surcharge is an optional fee, imposed and collected by airlines to recover fuel costs andstem losses caused by upward spikes in fuel cost.It said fuel surcharge is not a part of the basic airfare and maybe reduced or removed depending on the price of jetfuel in the market."
Jun 2022;"Crack Spreads Widen on Revenge Buying";"Crude oil prices are moving increasingly out of sync with products as global refiners struggle to meet so-calledâ€œrevenge demandâ€ for transport fuels. The term is being used to describe the huge appetite for all forms ofleisure travel being seen after the pandemic. Crude fell to a five-week low as fears of economic recession in the keyUS and European consuming markets took hold. International benchmark Brent shed $9.76 per barrel over theweek to close at $110.05/bbl Thursday while US price-pin West Texas Intermediate (WTI) saw a heftier $13.32/bblloss to end the week at $104.27/bbl.The Brent-WTI spread is now wide enough for US crude to be shipped to Europe at a profit. Product prices barelyflinched with little sign that high prices are enough to trigger demand destruction. ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO)futures fell less than 1% compared to a more than 8% slide in Brent futures. On Nymex, ultra-low-sulfur diesel(ULSD) futures dropped 5% compared to a more than 11% collapse in WTI. Sky-high US refinery profits havedrawn the attention of US President Joe Biden who is pressuring domestic refiners to boost gasoline production in abid to bring down record-high pump prices. Biden is also calling for the abolition of federal fuel duty for threemonths over the summer, which could further stoke buying. European jet demand is set to be severely capped byairport and airline staffing shortages this summer, frustrating huge pent-up demand for air travel in the region. Datafrom aviation analytics company Cirium show almost 2,000 flights from European airports being canceled in a singleweek this month with Amsterdamâ€™s Schiphol and Londonâ€™s Heathrow among the worst affected. TheUKâ€™s second-largest Gatwick airport has capped its slot availability to 850 per day in August in a bid to avoid arepeat of the last-minute cancellations seen over the Jubilee holiday weekend. That is 10% below its pre-pandemiccapacity and could set the limit for growth this summer. Budget carrier easyJet, which has large operations at bothGatwick and Schiphol, has already trimmed its summer schedule in response. The Spanish government hasmeanwhile enacted emergency legislation to halt industrial action by airline staff in a bid to avoid further disruptions.Traders say more jet imports are arriving in Europe, despite sky-high freight rates and steep marketbackwardation. But they warn that logistical bottlenecks could still hamper the onward flow of fuel to airports. Ontop of the staff shortages that seem to be affecting all corners of the aviation industry, low Rhine water levels arealso limiting inland barge flows. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp remain close to an all-time low, and31% below year-earlier levels, at 798,000 tons on Jun. 23, according to Insights Global. The week saw two jetcargo deals in the pricing window. Chinaâ€™s Unipec sold 30,000 tons into Rotterdam Jun. 27-Jul. 1 to BP lastFriday at a $135 per ton premium to July ICE LSGO futures. Swiss trader Glencore went on to sell 30,000 tons toShell into the UKâ€™s Shellhaven Jun. 30-Jul. 4 at a $10/ton premium to the c.i.f. cargo mean in Mondayâ€™swindow. Glencore nominated the LR2 Suvretta coming from Ruwais in the United Arab Emirates. US jet fuelmarkets are caught up in the fierce competition among transport fuels for scarce downstream capacity. Utilizationrates have risen to nearly 94%, giving US refiners little scope to increase crude runs to produce more gasoline, jetfuel and diesel. Refiners are chasing banner margins for middle distillates, with diesel crack spreads soaring abovegasoline at $70/bbl. June jet fuel demand is still ramping up to pre-Covid-19 levels, averaging about 250,000barrels per day below the 1.8 million b/d peak in 2019 at a time when the US downstream sector is already runningat full tilt. Pent-up demand for air travel this summer has packed airplanes and exposed staff shortages at airlinesand airports. Delta is scaling back capacity by 10% to minimize disruptions and avoid flight cancellations. The rallyin US diesel prices lost some steam this week. The July Nymex contract lost 7Â¢ per gallon to close at $4.34 onThursday, for a 6Â¢ loss from last week. Jet spreads also weakened in the major trading regions except for NewYork, where differentials climbed to 6.5Â¢/gallon below Nymex diesel futures. With Gulf Coast spreads softening toa 21Â¢ discount, the economics for sending jet fuel up the Colonial pipeline generate hefty profits for shippers.Average US spot rates have retreated to $4.24/gallon, just slightly ahead of Northwest Europe. That makes thecompetition for import barrels even more intense at a time of peak summer demand. Asian jet markets weakenedto their lowest level in a month. The Singapore spot price differential dropped by 44Â¢/bbl to a premium of $2.89/bblto Singapore quotes on Jun. 23. The prompt demand outlook hinges on the restart of international flights in China,where domestic services still dominate. Scheduled airline capacity for the week of Jun. 20 rose by 4.4% inNortheast Asia due to a 5% in increase in China, the worldâ€™s second-largest domestic aviation market,according to data analysis firm OAG. International flights account for less then 1% of Chinese airline capacity,which is restricting fuel usage. International air travel in China at the moment is only open for essential travel, OAGnoted. Airline capacity in Southeast Asia and South Asia saw little change.

That doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Andso from that, I do expect oil prices to remain high this summer.""The loss of several oil refineries due to COVID-19 has also impacted the price of gas.""There's less ability to produce gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that the market needs.

Jun 2022;"Airline labor crisis leads to a chaotic summer at airports";" Madrid 22 JUN 2022 - 06:06CESTWhat promises to be an exceptional summer of travel demand in Europe, after two years of pandemic restrictions,is turning out to be a tough bite to eat for airlines and airports.Ground handling staff and cabin crew are in short supply in key markets; jet fuel has risen above crude oil;and the recovery in mobility has stoked dormant labor disputes. Last week it was IAG CEO Luis Gallego who warned of a difficult few months ahead.The stunning sight of thousands of bags lost at London-Heathtrow due to operational problems last Monday onlyraised the alarm bells. There were more than 30 cancellations and the airport went so far as to ask airlines toreduce their throughput that day to get back on track. Yesterday it also emerged that the UK Department forTransport is to grant a waiver to airlines on the slot renewal rule to ease the pressure on the UK's main airport.Prior to this, British Airwayshad cancelled 10% of its supply until October to avoid further disruption since March.Iberia, also owned by IAG, has complained this month of serious problems in connections at Madrid-Barajas due to a lackof police personnel at passport control, which has led to reinforcements by the Ministry of the Interior.Another major airline, Easyjet, announced on Monday a downward correction in its production, due to the risk of collapse in two of its mostimportant bases, the British Gatwick and the Dutch Amsterdam. More than 11,000 flights could be affected bySeptember, out of the 160,000 that the orange airline usually operates in the summer months. There are even plansto eliminate seats on the planes to adapt the passengers to the crews.Such is the mismatch between supply capacity and demand that the Amsterdam airport has anticipated that it willlimit the volume of passengers this summer, which translates into a 16% reduction in the number of flightsscheduled.Strikes In termsof strikes, the largest airline in terms of passenger traffic, Ryanair, is facingstrikes by its cabin crew in five countries practically simultaneously. It is threatened with six days of strike action inSpain, called by USO and Sitcpla on June 24, 25 and 26, and from Thursday 30 of this month to July 2; the Belgianunions ACV Puls and CNE, also the Portuguese SNPVAC, have called the strike on June 24, 25 and 26; in Francethe call of SNPNC is for June 25 and 26, and the Italian FILT-CGIL has set the protest on the 25th. The generalizeddemand is the hiring under local labor regime and the negotiation of agreements. Despite the fact that theseprotests affect 2,700 flight attendants, Ryanair is confident that there will be a minimum of follow-through.Before facing this fire, the president of the Irish airline, Michael O'Leary, assures that the lack of personnel is not affecting it, but he does recognize, in declarations to Sky, that lastweekend a quarter of its flights suffered delays which he blames on air traffic control.As far as Spain is concerned, British airline Easyjet also has the airline's airline unions on strike, with nine days ofprotest announced yesterday: July 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 29, 30 and 31. In the midst of negotiations on the secondagreement, it is the USO union that is complaining that the proposals of the workforce are being blocked.In France, Air Francepilots are ready to mobilize. The Alter union, with a little more than 20% representationamong the collective, has set a strike for Saturday 25. The confrontation reaches the low-cost subsidiary Transavia, with a high volume of operations to Spain.In the Lufthansa group, which is going to cancel about 1,000 flights in July in order to stabilize its operations, it isBrussels Airines which has half a thousand flights in check from tomorrow until Saturday in view of the strikeannounced by the representatives of the TCP. In the end, 315 operations have been cancelled and some 40,000passengers affected. And the situation in Brussels is aggravated by a strike of the security personnel who alreadyblocked the Zaventem airport on Monday. Paris-Charles de Gaulle, for its part, faces a labor dispute as of July 1.In Northern Europe, beyond the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting airspace closures, alabor dispute has erupted at the Norwegian Air Traffic Technicians Organization (NFO), which is already causing cancellations in Scandinavia.The summer has just begun and the conflict in a key sector for the European economy is escalating. IAG andRyanair predict that stabilization, following the shutdown of engines during the pandemic, will take several moremonths."
Jun 2022;"World Bank revises annual global economic growth forecast";" WASHINGTON (dpa-AFX) - The World Bank has sharply lowered its forecast for this year's global economicgrowth, due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Globaleconomic output is expected to grow by 2.9% this year, the World Bank announced on Tuesday in its latest GlobalEconomic Prospects report. This is down from the institution's forecast of 4.1% growth in January, beforeFebruary's start of the war in Ukraine. Following the recession in 2020, when the coronavirus first broke out, theglobal economy had grown by a swift 5.7% the following year, according to the World Bank. Now, ""the war inUkraine, lockdowns in China, supply chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For manycountries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said World Bank President David Malpass. Due to high inflation rates,the World Bank predicted a higher risk of stagflation - an economy with low or falling growth, high unemploymentand rising inflation. According to the new forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) in the eurozone is expected togrow by only 2.5% this year, instead of the 4.2% anticipated in January. For the US, the world's largest economy,growth expectations for 2022 have been lowered by 1.2 percentage points to 2.5%, while China's economy isexpected to grow by 4.3%, 0.8 percentage points less than expected in January.

Jun 2022;"Gloom deepens for global economy";"The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, on Wednesday marked down globaleconomic growth for the coming two years, citing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a major cause.The OECD now forecasts that global expansion will decelerate sharply to around 3 percent this year and 2.8percent in 2023, both well below the recovery projected in its last Economic Outlook report released in December.The Paris-based organization expects inflation to average 8.8 percent this year across its 38 members, whichinclude some of the biggest economies. It said that in some advanced economies, inflation is now expected toreach levels not seen since the 1970s, as is already the case in Germany, the United States and the UnitedKingdom.China's economy is expected to grow 4.4 percent in 2022 and 4.9 percent in 2023, according to the OECD.""Amid mounting headwinds, growth will be supported by investment in the climate transition and the frontloading ofinfrastructure projects,"" the report said.It also said that real estate investment in China will remain weak, but exports will remain relatively strong. AndChina's large oil and grain reserves will mitigate the impact of rising global energy and food prices.The OECD marked down the US' GDP growth to 2.46 percent for 2022 from the 3.73 percent in its Decemberforecast. Inflation in the US will hit 5.9 percent compared to the 4.4 percent in the December forecast.The organization said that the economic and social impact of the conflict is strongest in Europe, reflectingvulnerabilities with costlier energy imports and refugee flows.The European Union, the largest client of Russian energy, announced it would phase out Russian coal imports inAugust while imposing a partial ban on Russian oil by the end of the year.Real GDP growth in the 19-member eurozone is expected to be 2.6 percent this year and 1.6 percent in 2023.OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said he is not forecasting a recession but slower growth.""Countries worldwide are being hit by higher commodity prices, which add to inflationary pressures and curb realincomes and spending, dampening the recovery,"" he told a news conference for the latest report.He described the Russia-Ukraine conflict as resulting in ""lower real incomes, lower growth and fewer jobopportunities worldwide"".The OECD said that uncertainty around the outlook is high, with prominent downside risks and it's hard to tell howmuch longer the conflict will go on and how much worse it may get.Rising pricesMany low-income and emerging-market economies will be challenged even more by rising food and energy prices,slower demand growth in their export markets, and the potential for capital outflows as interest rates rise in theadvanced countries, the OECD said. It cautioned that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over and more aggressive orcontagious variants may emerge.""The outlook is sobering,"" said OECD Chief Economist Laurence Boone, adding that the world is already paying aprice for the Russia-Ukraine conflict. ""The choices made by policymakers and citizens will be crucial to determinehow much higher that price will be and how the burden will be shared. Famine is not a price the world should pay.""Asked by China Daily whether Western sanctions on Russia have a negative impact on the global economicgrowth and supply chains, both Cormann and Boone dodged the question and instead emphasized that sanctionsare effective in hurting the Russian economy.The OECD forecast came a day after the World Bank marked down global economic growth to 2.9 percent thisyear, down from the 4.1 percent it forecast in January.chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn"
Jun 2022;"World Bank dims outlook for global economy";"The Associated PressWASHINGTON - The World Bank has sharply downgraded its outlook for the global economy, pointing to Russia'swar against Ukraine, the prospect of widespread food shortages and concerns about the potential return of""stagflation"" - a toxic mix of high inflation and sluggish growth unseen for more than four decades.The 189-country anti-poverty agency predicted Tuesday that the world economy will expand 2.9% this year. Thatwould be down from 5.7% global growth in 2021 and from the 4.1% it had forecast for 2022 back in January.""For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,"" said David Malpass, the World Bank's president.The agency doesn't foresee a much brighter picture in 2023 and 2024: It predicts just 3% global growth for bothyears.For the United States alone, the World Bank has slashed its growth forecast to 2.5% this year from 5.7% in 2021and from the 3.7% it had forecast in January. For the 19 European countries that share the euro currency, itdowngraded the growth outlook to 2.5% this year from 5.4% last year and from the 4.2% it had expected inJanuary.In China, the world's second-biggest economy after the United States, the World Bank expects growth to slow to4.3% from 8.1% last year.Emerging market and developing economies are collectively forecast to grow 3.4% this year, decelerating from a6.6% pace in 2021.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has severely disrupted global trade in energy and wheat, battering a global economythat had been recovering robustly from the coronavirus pandemic. Already-high commodity prices have gone evenhigher as a result, threatening the availability of affordable food in poor countries.""There's a severe risk of malnutrition and of deepening hunger and even of famine,'' Malpass warned.The World Bank expects oil prices to surge 42% this year and for non-energy commodity prices to climb nearly18%. But it foresees oil and other commodity prices both dropping 8% in 2023. It likened the current spike in energyand food prices to the oil shocks of the 1970s.""Additional adverse shocks,'' the agency warned in its new Global Economic Prospects report, ""will increase thepossibility that the global economy will experience a period of stagflation reminiscent of the 1970s.''The prospect of stagflation poses a dilemma for the Federal Reserve and other central banks: If they continue toraise interest rates to combat inflation, they risk causing a recession. But if they try to stimulate their economies,they risk driving prices higher and making inflation an even more intractable problem.The World Bank noted that the previous period of stagflation required rate increases so steep that they tipped theworld into recession and led to a series of financial crises in the poor countries of the developing world."
Jun 2022;"OECD cuts global economic outlook due to Ukraine";"LONDON (AP) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the energy and food crisis it has exacerbated will be a seriousdrag on global economic growth and a spike in inflation this year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) warned Wednesday.China's ""zero COVID"" policies, which have disrupted manufacturing supply chains, are also weighing on a globaleconomy that was just beginning to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the OECD added, becoming the latestinstitution to cut its growth forecast and underscoring a gloomy economic outlook.The OECD, a Paris-based club of largely wealthy nations, forecast the global economy to expand 3% in 2022,down from the 4.5% it expected in December.It also forecast inflation to be nearly 9% for the 38 OECD member countries, which include the U.S., U.K. and manyEuropean nations, nearly double previous estimates.The World Bank, United Nations and International Monetary Fund have made similar cuts to their economicforecasts recently.""Russia's war is imposing a very high price on the world economy,"" OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormannsaid at a press conference in Paris.The organization issued its forecast as it prepares for a two-day annual meeting starting Thursday, which will beattended by ministers from several governments. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will make some videocomments to participants.The OECD warned that the economic crisis will hit the poor hardest. The war is disrupting supplies of basicfoodstuffs and energy, of which Russia and Ukraine are major world suppliers, which is stoking inflation, eating intodisposable incomes and living standards, it added.The Russian invasion is hurting economic growth more in European nations because they are more exposed to thewar through trade and energy links, but the OECD also sounded the alarm about poor countries further afield facingfood shortages.""We are very concerned about the food situation in low-income countries. The war is really sending shock waves asfar as Africa and the Middle East,"" said OECD chief economist Laurence Boone. ""The war could cause famine. Itcould cause political unrest and turmoil."""

Jul 2022;"Prices Slump as Demand Fears Take Hold";"Oil prices fell sharply through midweek after ongoing supply concerns quickly became overwhelmed by urgent fearsover the state of global oil demand. The July Fourth holiday is normally one of the busiest days of the year formainstay US gasoline sales but data released this week by GasBuddy showed pump sales down by a surprise 10%on the previous Monday. Brent crude oil futures fell below $100 per barrel for the first time since Apr. 25 on fears ofa global economic recession before rebounding on Thursday.Russia has threatened to cut off Europeâ€™s gas supply prompting analysts to warn the economic shock couldsend a â€œrecessionary tsunamiâ€ around the world. Europe is already at the sharp end of Western sanctionsagainst Russia through its overreliance on Russian crude and diesel as well as natural gas. The euro dropped to a20-year low against the US dollar this week, only adding to the regionâ€™s inflationary woes. Brent suffered threedays of losses before bouncing back to close at $104.65/bbl Thursday, down $10.16/bbl from last week. US price-pin West Texas Intermediate ended the week at $102.73/bbl for a loss of $6.30/bbl. Europeâ€™s aviation recoveryhas hit the buffers with airport staffing shortages forcing tens of thousands more summer flights to be canceled.Network manager Eurocontrol had expected traffic to get back to 90% of pre-pandemic levels this summer, andmake a full recovery by next year, but may soon have to revise its forecasts. Traffic was just 13% below 2019 levelsin the seven days to Jul. 6, according to its latest figures. But there are huge discrepancies: Departures fromTurkeyâ€™s Istanbul airport are up 6% on pre-pandemic levels, while Germanyâ€™s Frankfurt is down 24% andMunich down 31%, Londonâ€™s Heathrow down 18%, Paris Charles de Gaulle down 19% and Amsterdamâ€™sSchiphol down 15%. Airlines are desperately rejigging their summer schedules in a bid to prioritize holiday flights.European jet fuel differentials have more than halved in the last week with cargoes in Northwest Europe pegged ata $28.75 per metric ton premium to front-month ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures Thursday, down from more than$60/ton at the end of last week and more than $100/ton the week before. Regional jet demand appears to becapped at around 1.2-1.3 million barrels per day with higher cargo imports and local production starting to exceed it.East of Suez jet arrivals are now pegged at 1.6 million tons (407,000 b/d) in July, up from just 1.3 million tons lastmonth. The week saw two cargo deals, both in Wednesdayâ€™s window. Chinaâ€™s Unipec sold 30,000 tons toShell into Le Havre Jul. 21-25 at a $12/ton premium to the Platts c.i.f. cargo mean (CCM), and 30,000 tons toGlencore into Rotterdam Jul. 16-20 at CCM plus $11/ton. A bullish report on product stocks that revealed themagnitude of the shortfall turned the tides for US mid-distillate markets. Jet fuel markets staged a dramaticrecovery after a two-day losing streak that pushed basis diesel futures down by 53Â¢ per gallon. The Nymex ultra-low-sulfur diesel contract recovered half of that loss on Thursday, climbing by 26Â¢ to close at $3.67/gallon.Average spot jet prices have fallen to 50Â¢ from their 30-day average to $3.61/gallon but maintain a healthypremium to Northwest Europe and Asia, ensuring imports will flow into US ports. New York Harbor spreadsnarrowed by 13Â¢/gallon to trade nearly even with the August diesel contract. West Coast differentials tightened to8Â¢ below the print amid possible outages at a Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles and a Chevron plant near SanFrancisco. The busy July Fourth holiday period saw jet fuel sales spike to pre-pandemic levels of 1.8 million b/d forthe first time, even as airlines canceled more than 1,400 flights due to bad weather and staff shortages. Filling on-airport storage tanks in anticipation of the surge drove US stocks down by 1.5 million barrels to 39.9 million in theweek ended Jul. 1 â€ a shortfall of 11% versus year-earlier. A build on the East Coast partly offset a 1.6 million bbldrop on the Gulf Coast. Jet exports fell by nearly 50% to 104,000 b/d as more supplies were diverted to thedomestic market. Imports plunged by more than 80% to 25,000 b/d with fewer cargoes arriving from Asianproducers. Asian jet markets took a tumble even as significant arbitrage jet volumes headed West of Suez andoverall air traffic rose in Asian aviation markets. Benchmark Singapore spot price differentials shed 98Â¢/bbl to apremium of $1.63/bbl to Singapore quotes on Jul. 7 â€ down from $3.77/bbl a month ago.

An additional 1.4 million bbl of arbitrage jet are loading in first-half July from Qatar, the UAE andSaudi Arabia and are pointed at Europe, with expected arrival dates ranging from Jul. 23 to Aug.2, according toKpler. Rising airline capacity in Asia is lifting prompt jet demand. For the week of Jul. 4 capacity climbed by 4% inNortheast Asia and by 3% in Southeast Asia, according to data analysis firm OAG.

Jul 2022;"Oil Jumps as Winter Energy Crisis Looms";"Supply concerns took hold again as the oil market moved to the October futures contract and the prospect of awinter energy crisis in Europe. The EU has already implemented gas rationing to cope with already drasticallyreduced flows from Russia. The â€œSave Gas for a Safe Winterâ€ plan seeks to cut the blocâ€™s gas use by15% until at least spring 2023. High natural gas prices are already prompting European refineries to switch tolighter, sweeter crudes. That means they produce more gasoline and not enough diesel and jet fuel.International crude benchmark ICE Brent rose $3.28 per barrel on the week to close at $107.14/bbl Thursday. USdomestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate put on just 7Â¢/bbl to finish at $96.42/bbl on continued emergencystock releases. US strategic oil reserves are now at their lowest since 1985 with further drawdowns still expected inthe coming months as the Biden administration looks to ease energy costs for US consumers. European spot jetcargo differentials came under renewed pressure with heavy imports proving too much for the regionâ€™s still-fragile summer airline fuel demand. Cargoes were pegged at a $54.75 per metric ton premium to August ICE low-sulfur gasoil futures at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from $65.50/ton a week ago. Flat prices were still up 6% on theweek on the back of a 7.5% jump in ICE LSGO as the whole oil complex moved higher. August arrivals from theMideast and Asia are pegged at the same 1.6 million tons seen in July. Airport staffing shortages are meanwhilebeing compounded by industrial action. Germanyâ€™s Lufthansa was forced to cancel more than 1,000 flights Jul.27 after its ground staff staged a walkout to demand higher pay. European air traffic is stuck at 87% of pre-pandemic levels, according to network manager Eurocontrol. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp are nowtheir highest since early May, according to stock monitor Insights Global. At 822,000 tons on Jul. 27, jet inventoriesare 30% lower than this time last year but up 4% on pre-Covid-19 2019 levels. The week saw three public jet fuelcargo deals all indexed to Platts prices. Floating prices have become the norm as traders look for ways of copingwith the dramatically increased price volatility since Russiaâ€™s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Almost half ofEuropeâ€™s jet cargo deals were done against ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures last year. That share hascollapsed to 12.5% since the invasion. Trafigura sold to Shell into Antwerp and Unipec to BP into Rotterdam inThursdayâ€™s pricing window after Unipec had already sold to Shell into Le Havre on Monday. July volumealready stands at a 10-month high of 390,000 tons with one trading session still to go. US jet fuel markets took offinto higher altitudes as prices tacked on 24Â¢ per gallon and more than offset a steep fall last week. Basis dieselfutures closed at $3.69/gallon and put outright quotes back into the $3.42-$3.64/gallon range. New York Harborbarrels held onto their 4Â¢ premium to August diesel futures before that contract expired on Friday. New York areaairports are seeing peaking jet demand as long-haul flights approach 2019 levels. All other regions linked tocheaper September futures contracts showed steep discounts. Gulf Coast jet spreads widened their discount to20Â¢/gallon below the print, providing strong returns for Colonial pipeline shipments to the Northeast. Los Angelesdifferentials narrowed to 9.5Â¢ below September futures. Their wide 30Â¢/gallon premium versus Asian pricesensures the steady flow of cargoes across the Pacific. A 130,000 barrel per day spurt in jet usage pushed demandback up to nearly 1.8 million b/d in the week ending Jul. 22, matching the levels seen during the July Fourth holidayperiod. Refiners lifted output to 1.76 million b/d as jet yields climbed to 10.7%. Middle distillate margins are still atrecord highs even after retreating from their peak in late April. Jet cracks in the week ended Jul. 23 settled at$43.70/bbl, versus low-sulfur diesel at $50.23 and gasoline at $30.20. Jet exports tumbled by 190,000 b/d to85,000 b/d â€ their lowest levels since late February.

Jul 2022;"Air Travel Resurgence Lifts Global Jet Fuel Demand";"Airlines are emerging from the pandemic only to face more turbulence. Headwinds from high fuel prices, laborshortages and a fragile economic situation are complicating the recovery, which is now well under way. Pent-uptravel demand has sparked a boom in air travel this summer, transforming jet fuel from the laggard to the fastest-growing refined product. Jet fuel demand is expected to post a 15% gain this year to 6.5 million barrels per day,according to latest Energy Intelligence assessments.A similar rise in 2023 should bring it close to peak 2019 levels of 7.9 million b/d. This yearâ€™s rebound would putjet fuel demand in the Americas just 7% below 2019 levels, with Europe showing a 15% shortfall. Asia is thefurthest behind with regional demand expected to reach 75% of 2019 rates this year, our figures show. All of thisyearâ€™s gain comes from OECD countries, where fuel usage shows a 36% rebound. US jet fuel markets haverestored 90% of their pre-Covid-19 size as demand approaches 1.6 million b/d. Planned capacity expansion in theUS and Europe that would have lifted demand even further have been reined in by labor shortages across allsegments of the business. European jet demand is projected to jump by 70% from 2021 to reach 1.2 million b/d thisyear after dropping to less than 200,000 b/d at the start of the pandemic. Regional air traffic was back to 86% ofpre-pandemic levels in late June, according to network manager Eurocontrol, but has fallen to 84% with thecancellation of flights at UK airports, Amsterdamâ€™s Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle in Paris, where strike actiondisrupted operations. The number of flights is still creeping up for the summer season, while rerouting to avoidRussian airspace has added to fuel use. China's Setback Frayed connectivity is still apparent in Asia, wheregovernments have been slower to remove travel restrictions. The setback in China dominates the regional picture,which is the only area to see demand contract this year and accounts for the 3% drop in non-OECD consumption.Lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing imposed in April under Beijingâ€™s zero-Covid-19 policy slashed Chinaâ€™sfuel usage to 200,000 b/d in May from average levels of 800,000 b/d last year, when domestic air traffic hadnormalized. Airports in Dubai and Qatar are regaining their role as major gateways for travel from Europe to Asia,lifting Middle Eastern fuel usage back to 2019 levels by next year. A rebound in Brazil is spurring all of the 20% risein Latin America. Labor shortages in the US and Europe have caused widespread flight cancellations and promptedcapacity cutbacks. After two years of massive downsizing, airlines and airports are not equipped to handle thetravel surge, which peaked in the US during the July Fourth holiday period. More than 1,400 flights were canceledand 14,000 delayed due to staffing issues and bad weather. An acute pilot shortage forced American Airlines toground a regional carrier earlier this year that serviced smaller cities. In Europe, British Airways has scrapped30,000 flights between April and October to minimize cancellations. Eurocontrolâ€™s Director-General EamonnBrennan said a lack of financial assistance during the pandemic meant that airports have taken much longer torecover. He admitted that, â€œJuly and August are going to be difficult.â€ Underlying metrics show the recoverygathering strength. By the end of May global passenger traffic flows had reached 70% of pre-pandemic levels asinternational travel gained more traction, according to latest International Air Transport Association (IATA) data.International travel accounts for 40% of the market and had jumped 325% versus May 2021. Cargo markets haveweakened this year after achieving a full recovery in 2021.

Jul 2022;"Fuel Prices Slide as Demand Falters";"Product prices are reeling on signs of demand destruction as the US and Europe head toward economic recession.Delayed data from the US Energy Information Administration show US gasoline demand starting to crumble withthe latest four-week average at its lowest seasonal level since 2014. Mainstay US gasoline buying is now on trackto fall in June for the first time since last November. Product prices have fallen twice as hard as crude in recentweeks. Europeâ€™s ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures are down 17% from their most recent peak on Jun.9, with losses of more than 10% seen in the last week. That compares to only a 7% dip in Brent crude futures onthe same exchange, prices for which actually rose this week. Nymex shows a similar picture, with gasoline futuresdown 16.5% versus a 10% slide in WTI. But fuel prices remain elevated with current refining capacity still strugglingto catch up with the post-pandemic recovery in demand and replace tainted Russian production. That is givingprolonged support to crude prices: Benchmark Brent and WTI crude futures were both up by an identical $4.76 perbarrel this week. Brent closed at $114.81/bbl Thursday, down from a recent peak of $117.98/bbl on Jun. 28, whileWTI finished the week at $109.03/bbl having nudged $111.76/bbl Tuesday. Labor shortages continue to hamperEuropeâ€™s aviation recovery this summer with Germanyâ€™s Lufthansa just the latest major airline to announcefurther cuts to its schedule. ""We will hardly be able to achieve a short-term improvement now,"" Lufthansa boardmember Detlef Kayser told newspaper Die Welt , adding that he expected the situation to return to normal by 2023.Lufthansa had already scrapped 900 flights in July and has now cut a further 2,000 from its summer schedule thismonth and next. Eurocontrolâ€™s Director General Eamonn Brennan said a lack of financial assistance to airportsduring the pandemic meant it was taking them much longer to recover. In a Jun. 27 market update, he admittedâ€œJuly and August are going to be difficult,â€ with airport delays already back to 2019 levels despite fewer flights.Air traffic was 84.5% of pre-pandemic levels last week, according to Eurocontrol. No jet cargoes changed hands inEuropeâ€™s sparse end-of-day pricing window last week. That kept June volume at just 150,000 metric tons or itslowest pre-summer season volume on record. Year-to-date volumes are down 25% on last year, despite a near-tripling of airline fuel demand with public spot trade now at its lowest since 2017. Cargo premiums have come offsharply as summer schedules have been slashed. Benchmark price provider S&P Platts pegged northwestEuropean jet at a $76.50/ton premium to front-month July ICE LSGO futures at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from a$114/ton premium the previous week. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp were static, according toInsights Global, despite tanker arrivals from India and South Korea. The sea-change in US jet fuel markets erasedall of the June price gains as Nymex diesel futures plunged by nearly 50Â¢ per gallon. Average spot jet pricesdropped to $3.77/gallon, with Gulf Coast rates losing the most ground as the discount to August diesel futureswidened to 17Â¢. Jet fuel in Los Angeles strengthened to 10Â¢ below the screen to attract imported supplies. USimports fell to 150,000 barrels per day or just two-thirds of recent levels in the week ended Jun. 24. Refiners arerunning at 95% of capacity to capture soaring margins for gasoline and middle distillates. Jet fuel output averaged1.66 million b/d through most of June, lifting overall stocks to 41.4 million bbl. Persistent flight cancellations aretaking their toll on fuel usage, which slipped below 1.5 million b/d for the first time since May. Passenger traffic andfuel usage are expected to surge during the Jul. 4 holiday period. Airlines are proactively canceling flights as staffshortages hamper operations. Delta waived its rebooking fees for the first time ever in anticipation of more mayhemat airports across the country this weekend. The increased hassle of air travel could do more to dampen pent-updemand for flying than higher airfares as steep fuel prices give airlines an excuse to boost ticket prices. WeakerAsian jet markets saw benchmark Singapore price differentials at one point tumbling to a five-month low. TheSingapore spot price differential plunged to a premium of 52Â¢/bbl to Singapore quotes on Jun. 27, its lowest levelsince Jan. 10. The premium subsequently bounced back to $2.61/bbl above Singapore quotes on Jun. 30, whichstill represents a drop of 28Â¢/bbl from last week. A total of 100,000 bbl of July-loading jet traded from Jun. 24-30in the Platts Singapore trading window. China Aviation Oil sold the volumes to PetroChina on Jun. 30 in one lot at apremium of $1.70/bbl to Singapore quotes. Airline capacity across Asia continued to edge higher. Scheduled airlinecapacity for the week of Jun. 27 rose by 3% from the previous week in Northeast Asia due to a 4% increase inChina, according to aviation data analysis firm OAG.

Both indices have fallen back from the extreme levels seenin 2020 but are still above pre-pandemic levels.The largest fall in confidence occurred in the Middle East, a region more exposed to trade with Russia/Ukrainewhile North America and Western Europe recorded especially large falls due to big jumps in inflation in recentmonths."

Jul 2022;"UK companies’ confidence in global economy slumps";"UK business confidence in the global economy has slumped to its lowest level in a decade amid the cost of livingcrisis and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a survey of FTSE 350 companies.The Boardroom Bellwether survey found that 76 per cent of the companies that responded expect the economy toshrink in the next year — the biggest annual swing in sentiment since the research was first conducted a decadeago. In the poll this time last year, 96 per cent of companies that replied predicted the economy to improve.The latest survey of FTSE 350 company secretaries, which is conducted by the Chartered Governance Institute UK& Ireland, a professional body, found that only 8 per cent of respondents expect the economy to improve.Meanwhile, 76 per cent of companies that replied predicted that the British economy will decline in the comingyear.The survey was based off 40 responses: 26 from the FTSE 100 and 14 from the FTSE 250.In last year’s poll, the vast majority of companies expected an improvement in the global economy in significantpart because of hopes that the UK and the rest of the world had turned the corner in the coronavirus pandemic.But the latest survey found companies citing global economic issues and geopolitical tensions as the biggest risksfacing them — countries are grappling with surging inflation after supply chain disruptions during the Covid-19pandemic, and the war in Ukraine has fuelled volatility in food and fuel prices.Almost a third of respondents also said Brexit was having a damaging effect on their operations.“With an awful war in Europe coming hard on the heels of a global pandemic, we’ve seen swings and switches inthe 2022 Boardroom Bellwether like never before,” said Peter Swabey, policy and research director at theChartered Governance Institute. The research is sponsored by the Financial Times.The plunge in business confidence has come as rising prices for goods and services has squeezed companies’profit margins and unleashed demands for substantial pay increases by employees.Official UK data for the June inflation rate will be issued on Wednesday, and economists expect it to hit a fresh 40-year high of 9.3 per cent, up from 9.1 per cent in May.The annual Boardroom Bellwether survey seeks to gauge sentiment inside British boardrooms by asking companysecretaries about the economy, market conditions and the wider business and governance environment.Almost four-fifths of FTSE 350 companies that replied said their exposure to risk was increasing, highlightinguncertainty in the outlook for business following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and disruption to supply chains.Almost two-thirds of respondents said that ensuring compliance with western sanctions was the biggest concern,followed by reviewing supply chain commitments with Russia, and the safeguarding of employees.Companies also outlined the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses, with almost all having made changes to office-based working, including allowing employees to operate from home at least some of the time.About a third of respondents plan to recruit more staff, and just under half said they would increase capitalexpenditure, suggesting that some businesses are not deterred from investing to expand their operations despitefears over deteriorating economic conditions.Almost half of companies that replied said scrutiny and rules around executive pay were proving detrimental torecruiting the right candidates for their boards and senior management."
Jul 2022;"Global economy: Outlook worsens as global recession looms, says IMF";"WASHINGTON - Still reeling from the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the global economy isfacing an increasingly murky and uncertain outlook, according to the latest report released on Tuesday by theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).The World Economic Outlook Update July 2022: Gloomy and More Uncertain, highlights the significantconsequences of the stalling of the world's three main economic powerhouses - the United States, China and themajor European economies.""The outlook has darkened significantly since April,"" said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, IMF Economic Counsellor andDirector of Research.""The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one"".The baseline forecast for global growth is for it to slow from 6.1 per cent last year, to 3.2 percent in 2022 - 0.4percent lower than forecast in the last Outlook update in April.With higher-than-expected inflation - especially in the US and the largest European economies - global financialconditions are becoming tighter.In the US, reduced household purchasing power and tighter monetary policy will drive growth down to 2.3 per centthis year and one percent next year, according to the outlook.China's slowdown has been worse than anticipated amid COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdowns, with negative effectsfrom Russia's invasion of Ukraine continuing.Moreover, further lockdowns and a deepening real estate crisis there has pushed growth down to 3.3 percent thisyear - the slowest in more than four decades, excluding the pandemic.And in the Eurozone, growth has been revised down to 2.6 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2023, reflectingspillovers from the Ukraine war and tighter monetary policy.""As a result, global output contracted in the second quarter of this year,"" said Gourinchas.InflationDespite the global slowdown, inflation has been revised up, in part due to rising food and energy prices.This year it is anticipated to reach 6.6 percent in advanced economies and 9.5 percent in emerging market anddeveloping economies - representing upward revisions of 0.9 and 0.8 percentage points respectively. And it isprojected to remain elevated for longer.Broadened inflation in many economies reflects ""the impact of cost pressures from disrupted supply chains andhistorically tight labour markets,"" the IMF official stated.The report outlines some risks ahead, including that the war in Ukraine could end European gas supply from Russiaaltogether; rising prices could cause widespread food insecurity and social unrest; and geopolitical fragmentationmay impede global trade and cooperation.Inflation could remain stubbornly high if labour markets remain overly tight or inflation expectations are toooptimistic and prove more costly than expected.And renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdowns threaten to further suppress China's growth.""In a plausible alternative scenario where some of these risks materialize...inflation will rise and global growthdecelerate further to about 2.6 percent this year and two per cent next year, a pace that growth has fallen below justfive times since 1970,"" said the IMF economist.""Under this scenario, both the United States and the Euro area experience near-zero growth next year, withnegative knock-on effects for the rest of the world"".Current inflation levels represent a clear risk to macroeconomic stability, according to the outlook.Responding to the situation, central banks in advanced economies are withdrawing monetary support faster thanexpected, while many in emerging market and developing economies began raising interest rates last year.""The resulting synchronized monetary tightening across countries is historically unprecedented, and its effects areexpected to bite, with global growth slowing next year and inflation decelerating,"" said Gourinchas.While acknowledging that tighter monetary policy would have economic costs, the IMF official upheld that delayingit would only exacerbate hardship.And hampered by difficulties in coordinating creditor agreements, how and whether debt can be restructured,remains unpredictable.He argued that domestic policies responding to the impacts of high energy and food prices should focus on thosemost affected, without distorting prices.""Governments should refrain from hoarding food and energy and instead look to unwind barriers to trade such asfood export bans, which drive world prices higher,"" advised the IMF official.Meanwhile, mitigating climate change continues to require prompt multilateral action to limit emissions and raiseinvestment to accelerate a ""green transition"".Policymakers are urged to ensure that measures are temporary and only cover energy shortfalls and climatepolicies.From climate transition and pandemic preparedness to food security and debt distress, multilateral cooperation iskey, said the IMF economist.""Amid great challenge and strife, strengthening cooperation remains the best way to improve economic prospectsand mitigate the risk of geoeconomic fragmentation,"" he underscored. - UN News"
Aug 2022;"Recession Fears Hit Crude and Diesel Harder Than Jet";"Jet fuel losses were less than crude and other products with pent-up demand for air travel after the pandemichelping offset fears of an economic recession. International benchmark Brent lost $13.02 per barrel over the weekto close at $94.12/bbl Thursday, while US domestic price-pin West Texas Intermediate shed $7.88/bbl to finish at$88.54/bbl. The UKâ€™s Bank of England has warned the country is heading for a long recession, declaringâ€œthere is an economic cost to the warâ€ in Ukraine after raising interest rates again this week to combat energyprice-driven inflation. Oil prices still stand 34% above year-earlier levels despite coming off recent peaks of almost$125/bbl in June. A shock rise in US oil inventories this week suggests fuel demand is already starting to fall in theworldâ€™s largest oil market.Traders fear this might just be the calm before the storm with EU sanctions against Russia set to cause more pricehavoc this winter. The EU will stop importing Russian crude from Dec. 5 while a blocwide ban on product imports,mainly ultra-low-sulfur diesel and heating oil, is due to take full effect next year â€ at the height of the heatingseason. Russia has already tightened the taps on Europeâ€™s natural gas supply, meaning demand for oil couldbe even higher than usual. The CEO of Italian refiner Saras Dario Scaffardi this week said the market lookedâ€œextremely constructive.â€ â€œMy view is that this is just a pause in a strong market,â€ he added, commentingon the recent dip in European refining margins. Opec-plus agreed only a 100,000 barrel per day increase inproduction from September, less than the 400,000 b/d per month gains seen so far this year. European jet cargodifferentials were pegged at a $57.50 per metric ton premium to roller-coaster August ICE low-sulfur gasoil futuresat Thursdayâ€™s close, up slightly from $54.75/ton a week ago. Flat jet fuel prices fell only 8% on the weekcompared to a 12% drop in Brent crude and 10% slide in diesel. New data from Spanish fuels distributor Exolumhighlights the current disconnect between Europeâ€™s jet fuel and diesel markets. Jet demand was up almost50% year on year in Spain in July while diesel buying slumped 1% year on year as motorists balked at high pumpprices. Spanish jet demand has reached 3.3 million cubic meters so far this year, still 20% below the 4.1 millioncubic meters used between January and July 2019, before the pandemic. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr warnedthat the airline industry has reached its operational limit as the German flag carrier reported its first quarterly profitsince before the pandemic. European carriers have been forced to cut back their summer schedules because of ashortage of airport staff. The week saw just one public cargo deal in Europe, on the marketâ€™s now preferredfloating price basis. BP sold 30,000 tons to Shell into the UKâ€™s Shellhaven Aug. 23-27 at a $12.50/ton premiumto S&P Plattsâ€™ Northwest Europe c.i.f. cargo mean averaged over eight days between Aug. 3-12. Indiaâ€™sEssar has launched a new into-wing fueling service at Liverpool airport, taking its UK airport portfolio to sixincluding Manchester, Birmingham and London Stansted, all supplied from its Stanlow refinery. Jet tanks inAmsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp were barely changed after a tanker arrived from Bahrain but smaller ships left forthe UK and Norway. Stocks stood at 818,000 tons on Aug. 4, according to Insights Global, down 25% on last yearbut 5% higher than at this point in summer 2019. August imports are pegged at a bumper 1.6 million tons. US jetfuel markets have lost their verve at the height of the summer travel season amid flagging demand and plentifulsupplies. The slump in basis diesel futures has aligned US prices more closely with levels in Europe, erasing theirsteep premium over the last several months. The September Nymex diesel contract has tumbled by 72Â¢ pergallon or nearly 20% since early July, losing another 8Â¢ on Thursday to close at $3.34/gallon. Jet spreads havealso weakened and brought average jet prices down to $3.22/gallon versus $3.17/gallon in Europe. New YorkHarbor quotes are still the highest in the country even after jet spreads fell from positive values last week to4Â¢/gallon below the September print on Thursday. Gulf Coast jet was trading at 22Â¢/gallon below diesel futures,while the discount in Los Angeles widened by 9Â¢ to 20Â¢/gallon. Gulf Coast refiners are consolidating their swingsupplier role as US shipments surged by 114,000 b/d to nearly 200,000 b/d, according to government data for theweek ending Jul. 29. Thatâ€™s twice the levels seen one year ago. Refiners are maximizing middle distillate outputas gasoline margins lag the $48/bbl cracks for jet fuel and $54/bbl for diesel. Jet output has topped 1.7 million b/dfor two weeks in a row. But third-quarter refinery maintenance has trimmed utilization rates slightly to 91% ofcapacity. Airline fuel usage is trending lower following a burst in late July. Jet sales plummeted by 331,000 b/d to1.44 million b/d last week. The supply overhang was channeled into storage, with stocks jumping by 1.5 millionbarrels to 41.6 million â€ their highest level in nearly a year. Heavy exports and stronger regional air traffic buoyedAsia's jet market. The benchmark Singapore spot price differential jumped by 32Â¢/bbl on the week to reach$1.30/bbl by Aug. 4, its highest in almost a month. A bumper 5.72 million bbl of jet is set to leave Asia this month,according to data intelligence company Kpler, heading to Europe and the US, with a further 770,000 bbl of jet withother products heading to East Africa from China. Volumes to Europe from the Mideast Gulf are also picking up with1.14 million bbl due to load from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait between Aug. 15-28 alone.

Aug 2022;"Supply chain disruptions: cost in the global economy";"Supply chain disruptions affected global growth by up to one percentage point, estimated the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF).In general, this occurs when the process flow involving any of the entities associated with the production, sale anddistribution of specific goods or services is interrupted.The IMF estimated that, in 2021, global supply chain disruptions reduced global GDP growth by 0.5 to 1.0percentage points, while adding 1.0 percentage point to core inflation.However, according to the World Trade Organization (WTO ), supply chain problems may have hindered trade,but likely had a limited impact on global merchandise trade aggregates, which continued to grow in 2021.Among the main drivers of supply chain disruptions in 2021 were the resurgence of pandemic-related restrictivepolicies, labor and materials shortages, rising input prices, transportation and logistics disruptions, port congestion,and container shortages.Supply chainFor its part, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) described the following cases as examples ofsignificant supply chain disruptions in 2021, affecting both consumers and producers.At times, consumers faced limited availability of goods while experiencing unusually long wait times to receive theproducts they ordered.Meanwhile, producers faced intermittent shortages of inputs and labor, as well as persistently long delivery times.Supply chain disruptions rippled throughout the economy, leading to higher prices for goods, adding upwardinflationary pressure, and hindering economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic-related recession in 2020."
Aug 2022;"No End To Local Airlines' Suffering As Fuel Price Continues To Skyrocket";"Link to ImageLink to StoryDhaka : Country's local airlines continue to suffer as they keep losing competitiveness globally over rapid increaseof jet fuel in the domestic market.Padma Oil Company, a subsidiary of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), on July 9 once again increased theprice of jet fuel by BDT 19 per litre, taking the already high jet fuel price to BDT 130 per litre.Aviation industry stakeholders are blasting BPC for their continuous whimsical moves claiming there is no logicbehind the jet fuel price hike as the rate is decreasing in the international market.This is the 16th time Padma Oil Company increased the price of jet fuel in the last 20 months.Previous hikes were in the range of BDT 2 to BDT 7. However, the latest was further termed unanticipated by airlinestakeholders of the country.Moreover, it is the air travellers who will face the blow as now they will have to pay more for air tickets due to thelatest price hike of jet fuel.Due to the unprecedented and rapid jet fuel price hikes, air fare has been increasing day by day.In December 2020, the price of jet fuel, which accounts for up to 46 per cent of the operational costs of an airline,was BDT 48 per litre.The price has increased 170 per cent in the last 20 months, according to reports.There is no logic behind BPC's latest move when the international rate is decreasing, said Mofizur Rahman,Secretary General of Aviation Operators Association of Bangladesh (AOAB) and Managing Director of NOVOAIR.Citing a report of International Air Transport Association, Rahman claimed last week ended with the price down 8.4per cent at USD 146.2 per standard barrel containing 42 United States gallons (bbl).The price decreased 19 per cent worldwide compared to that last month while BPC increased it by 18 per cent,added Rahman.He further mentioned BPC is making arbitrary moves.'We want to get rid of BPC's monopoly business and its whimsical decisions,' urged Rahman, adding, 'The airlineindustry of the country is on the way to collapse over rapid increase of jet fuel price.'Furthermore, Kazi Wahidul Alam, Editor of The Bangladesh Monitor and an aviation expert said, the country'sairline industry will not be able to survive unless the government extends its cooperation.Kamrul Islam, General Manager for Public Relations, US-Bangla Airlines, said, 'BPC is increasing the price of jetfuel almost every month. We are at risk of losing passengers if we increase the price of tickets accordingly.''On the contrary, airlines are at risk of going bankrupt if we do not increase airfares in tune,' he claimed.Kamrul Islam also said the tourism and hospitality sector which involves 40 lac people would also go down with theaviation industry as they are codependent on one another.Reports cited, a year and a half ago, the fare on a domestic route was around BDT 2,500 or so but has since goneup to around BDT 5,000.On this issue, Dr Md Sher Ali, Additional Secretary (Operations), Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources,said otherwise.'The price of jet fuel is set according to the international market.

Aug 2022;"Lower fuel surcharge means cheaper air fare next month";" Travelers planning to take a trip in September can expect their ticket prices to go down with the airline industrycommitting to comply with the government's order on lower fuel surcharge.Philippine Airlines spokesperson Cielo Villaluna said the flag carrier will enforce the corresponding changes in itsfuel surcharge as instructed by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).'The new fuel surcharge rates will be applicable to tickets that will be purchased in September,' Villaluna said in atext message to The STAR.Budget carrier Cebu Pacific also vowed to conform with the CAB order to decrease the fuel cost passed on topassengers. Cebu Pacific chief commercial officer Xander Lao said flight bookings should go up as a result of thesurcharge reduction.'This is a welcome development. We look forward to the lower fuel surcharge which should help make fares moreaffordable and stimulate air travel,' Lao told The STAR.AirAsia Philippines spokesman Steve Dailisan said the low-cost carrier will also adjust its ticket prices in line withthe CAB directive, as it hopes to capture the expected surge in travel demand for the holiday season beginningSeptember.'AirAsia Philippines welcomes the lowering of the fuel surcharge cost to Level 9 and will reflect the adjustments toits ticket prices accordingly,' Dailisan said.'This will benefit many of our guests who are now planning their travels in time for the -ber months,' he added.In an advisory, CAB set the fuel surcharge to Level 9 for September, from Level 12 in August, to reflect the latestdecline in the price of jet fuel. Level 9 means that airline firms can impose a fuel surcharge of P287 to P839 fordomestic flights and P947.39 to P7,044.27 for foreign trips.CAB said airline firms looking to slap the fuel surcharge in September must file its application to the agency on orbefore the effectivity period. The applicable conversion rate for the collection of fuel surcharge stands at P55.93 to$1.Fuel surcharge refers to the optional fee that airline firms enforce to recoup their fuel expenses and moderatefinancial losses due to sudden spikes in jet fuel prices.Fuel surcharge may be lowered or even removed by CAB depending on the price movement of jet fuel in theinternational market."
Aug 2022;"Demand Boost to Oil Prices as IEA Flags 'Extraordinary Gains'";"Oil prices rebounded from last week's lows after the International Energy Agency (IEA) declared â€œextraordinarygainsâ€ in global oil demand driven by fuel switching from natural gas in the power and industrial sectors.International benchmark Brent gained $5.48 per barrel over the week to close at $99.60/bbl Thursday, while USprice-pin West Texas Intermediate ended the week $5.80/bbl higher at $94.34/bbl. Brent has still fallen $30/bbl fromits $123.58/bbl peak on Jun. 8. The IEA has raised its estimates of global demand growth for this year and next by500,000 barrels per day to 2.1 million b/d in both years.Fuel switching will hike European oil consumption by roughly 300,000 b/d over the next year and a half, accordingto the agency. Earlier fears that high oil prices were starting to cause demand destruction, especially for road fuelsin the Atlantic Basin, are taking a back seat. Drought conditions in Europe have prompted Germanyâ€™s Lufthansato halt barge deliveries into Frankfurt airport after water levels on the River Rhine fell to dangerous levels. The flagcarrier is now relying solely on pipeline deliveries to meet peak, albeit still constrained, summer demand. Sourcessay the Nato CEPS pipeline is running at full capacity after maintenance work last month but warn that the RMRmultiproduct line also serving Frankfurt will need to prioritize diesel if inland markets become completely cut offfrom the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) trading hub. ARA jet tanks are now at their highest in 15 weeks,according to Insights Global, and 11% higher than at this point during the 2019 summer season. Recent ARA jetarrivals include tankers from China and Russia. The latter makes a mockery of EU efforts to wean itself off Russianfuels ahead of an outright ban due to come into force on Feb. 5. The week saw three jet cargo deals inEuropeâ€™s market-on-close pricing window. Swiss traders Vitol and Glencore pounced on window offers byChinaâ€™s Unipec into Rotterdam at the end of the month. Vitol paid a $7 per ton premium to the Plattsâ€™ c.i.f.cargo mean (CCM) for Aug. 25-29 delivery in Mondayâ€™s window, then CCM plus $9/ton for similar dates inThursdayâ€™s end-of-day session. Glencore paid a dollar more the same day. All deals were based on averagePlatts pricing over the four reporting days Aug. 25-31. Jet cargo differentials were pegged at $75.25/ton over thefront-month ICE low-sulfur gasoil contract at Thursday's close, up from $57.50/ton a week ago. The roller-coasterride for US jet fuel markets saw daily swings that kept average prices at $3.36 per gallon this week. Theunderlying low-sulfur diesel futures contract jumped by another 7Â¢ on Thursday, when it closed at $3.48/gallon.Jet spreads in most markets weakened further, putting outright jet quotes in the $3.23 to $3.38/gallon range orabout 10Â¢ below 30-day averages. New York Harbor differentials had been the strongest in the country but lostanother 4Â¢ to land at 10Â¢/gallon below the September futures contract. Middle distillate margins have retreatedbut remain well above gasoline returns. The crack spread for jet fuel fell by $10/bbl to $38 and slipped to $43 fordiesel, still well above the $22.50 for gasoline. Another surge in demand lifted fuel usage by 342,000 b/d to nearly1.8 million b/d in the week ended Aug. 5. That marked only the second time in the past five weeks that airline fueldemand climbed above 1.7 million b/d. After making downward revisions to its short-term outlook, the EnergyInformation Administration now sees US jet demand climbing by just 160,000 b/d this year to 1.53 million b/d.Refiners lifted output to 1.76 million b/d as utilization rates climbed above 94.3%. The finely balanced market pulledadditional supplies out of inventories to meet the demand surge. Gulf Coast refiners saw the largest 1.5 millionbarrel drop that pushed tank levels down to 12.4 million. After peaking at their highest level in nearly a year, overallstocks dipped by nearly 1 million bbl to 40.7 million â€ a 5% shortfall versus year-earlier. Asian jet markets plungedas benchmark Singapore spot price differentials dropped by $1.15 to a premium of 15Â¢/bbl to Singapore quoteson Aug. 11. That was the lowest level in seven months, when the premium fell to 9Â¢/bbl to Singapore quotes onJan. 10. Prompt jet demand is expected to take another hit after China imposed lockdowns in Hainan to control thepandemic outbreak there. Minor gains in scheduled airline capacity in Northeast Asia, South Asia and the MiddleEast had offset a decline in Southeast Asia in the week of Aug. 8, according to data analysis firm OAG. The latestnumbers do not reflect the closures in China. OAG noted that, â€œwe should expect to see at least a million seatsremoved next week as the two major airports are impacted.â€ That equates to a 6% drop from the first week ofAugust and wipes out recent capacity gains.

Aug 2022;"Oil Prices Rise on Supportive Product Outlook";"Oil futures regained momentum on Wednesday, finding support at the $94 per barrel mark and rebounding in thesecond half of the trading session. In London, the September Brent contract was up $1.09 and settled at$97.40/bbl, while in New York, the front-month Nymex West Texas Intermediate (WTI) August contract gained$1.43 and closed at $91.93/bbl. Last week, Brent traded at its lowest levels since Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukrainein February at $92.78/bbl.The North Sea benchmark has since struggled to regain ground. The weakness in the flat price has beenaccompanied by narrowing time spreads, suggesting a pause or some form of price consolidation in an otherwisebullish outlook. This could be the lull before the storm, as more supply tightness is looming once the EU ban onRussian crude comes into full effect on Dec. 5, traders said. Lack of Direction â€œWhat is clear is that the oilmarket is still struggling with both supply and demand uncertainty, and as a result the market is struggling toconvincingly find direction,â€ wrote Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING. Data from the USEnergy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed a 5.5 million barrel crude build in the week endingAug. 5. This may point to softer demand, but the rise partly reflects the recent 5.3 million bbl crude release from thenation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), as well as a sizable dip in crude exports. A 5 million bbl draw ingasoline inventories could be an indication that, on the contrary, demand is improving, especially with an uptick inrefinery throughputs: US average utilization rates were up 3.3 percentage points to 94.3% last week. MarginResilience US middle distillate stocks were up 2.2 million bbl, which is rather constructive given the ongoingtightness in the global diesel and jet fuel market. Despite the build, â€œthe gasoil cracks and spreads continued torally today,â€ Onyx Capital wrote. â€œThe September crack was up $2.20 to $38.70/bbl, while [the fourth-quartercrack] is up $1.50 to $36.35/bbl.â€ Meanwhile, the 3-2-1 crack spread was â€œfriskyâ€ again, traders said,breaking back above $40 after bottoming out at $34.56. This benchmark refining spread prices the differencebetween the cost of three barrels of crude and the sale proceeds of two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel.Refining margins in the US and Europe have come off their previous peaks of $40-$60/bbl and are now down to$30-$45/bbl. Despite the higher costs of natural gas and power, though, refiners said that the outlook is stillconstructive. Once the ban on Russian refined products come into full effect by year-end, the price impact is likelyto be much more material, they said, and margins could flare up fast again.Julien Mathonniere"
Aug 2022;"War threatens global economy";"Six months after Russian invasion, danger growsMECKENHEIM, Germany - Martin Kopf needs natural gas to run his family's company, Zinkpower GmbH, whichrustproofs steel components in western Germany.Zinkpower's facility outside Bonn uses gas to keep 600 tons of zinc worth 2.5 million euros ($2.5 million)in a molten state every day. The metal will harden otherwise, wrecking the tank where steel parts aredipped before they end up in car suspensions, buildings, solar panels and wind turbines.Six months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the consequences are posing a devastating threat to the globaleconomy, including companies like Zinkpower, which employs 2,800 people. Gas is not only much more costly,it might not be available at all if Russia completely cuts off supplies to Europe to avenge Westernsanctions, or if utilities can't store enough for winter.Germany may have to impose gas rationing that could cripple industries from steelmaking to pharmaceuticalsto commercial laundries. ""If they say, we're cutting you off, all my equipment will be destroyed,"" saidKopf, who also chairs Germany's association of zinc galvanizing firms.Governments, businesses and families worldwide are feeling the war's economic effects just two years afterthe coronavirus pandemic ravaged global trade. Inflation is soaring, and rocketing energy costs haveraised the prospect of a cold, dark winter. Europe stands at the brink of recession.High food prices and shortages, worsened by the cutoff of fertilizer and grain shipments from Ukraine andRussia that are slowly resuming, could produce widespread hunger and unrest in the developing world.Outside Uganda's capital of Kampala, Rachel Gamisha said Russia's war in faraway Ukraine has hurt hergrocery business. She has felt it in surging prices for necessities like gasoline, selling for $6.90 agallon. Something that's 2,000 shillings (about $16.70) this week may cost 3,000 shillings ($25) nextweek.""You have to limit yourself,'' she said. ""You have to buy a few things that move fast.''Gamisha has noticed something else, too - a phenomenon called ""shrinkflation"": A price may not change, buta doughnut that used to weigh 45 grams may now be only 35 grams. Bread that weighed 1 kilogram is now 850grams.Russia's war led the International Monetary Fund last month to downgrade its outlook for the globaleconomy for the fourth time in under a year. The lending agency expects 3.2 percent growth this year, downfrom the 4.9 percent it forecast in July 2021 and well below a vigorous 6.1 percent last year.""The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one,""Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF's chief economist, said.The U.N. Development Program said rising food and energy prices threw 71 million people worldwide intopoverty in the first three months of the war. Countries in the Balkans and sub-Saharan Africa were hithardest. Up to 181 million people in 41 countries could suffer a hunger crisis this year, the U.N. Foodand Agriculture Organization has projected.In Bangkok, rising costs for pork, vegetables and oil have forced Warunee Deejai, a street-food vendor, toraise prices, cut staff and work longer hours.""I don't know how long I can keep my lunch price affordable,'' she said. ""Coming out from COVID lockdownsand having to face this is tough. Worse is, I don't see the end of it.''Even before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, the global economy was underpressure. Inflation had skyrocketed as a stronger-than-expected recovery from the pandemic recessionoverwhelmed factories, ports and freight yards, causing delays, shortages and higher prices. In response,central banks began raising interest rates to try to cool economic growth and tame spiking prices.""We've all got all these different things going on,'' said Robin Brooks, chief economist at theInternational Institute of Finance. ""The volatility of inflation went up. The volatility of growth wentup. And therefore, it's become infinitely harder for central banks to steer the ship.''China, pursuing a zero-COVID policy, imposed lockdowns that have severely weakened the world's second-biggest economy. At the time, many developing countries still grappled with the pandemic and the heavydebts they had taken on to protect their populations from economic disaster.All those challenges might have been manageable. But when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Westresponded with heavy sanctions. Both actions disrupted trade in food and energy. Russia is the world'sthird-biggest petroleum producer and a leading exporter of natural gas, fertilizer and wheat. Farms inUkraine feed millions globally.The resulting inflation has rippled out to the world.Near Johannesburg, South Africa, Stephanie Muller has been comparing prices online and checking differentgrocery stores to find the best deals.""I have three children who are all in school, so I have been feeling the difference,'' she said.Shopping at a market in Vietnam's capital of Hanoi, Bui Thu Huong said she's been limiting her spendingand cutting back on weekend dinners out.

Aug 2022;"Global economic activity weakens";"World economic activity weakened during the second quarter of 2022, informed the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) inits quarterly report released on Wednesday.The sluggishness in world economic activity is mainly due to the continuation of the economic effects derived fromthe war between Russia and Ukraine; the slowdown in China's economy, largely due to the implementation ofmeasures to contain the resurgence of Covid-19 infections; and the tightening of global financing conditions due toa more accelerated withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the face of high inflation levels. Timely indicators point tothis weakening extending into the early third quarter.As a result, the global growth outlook for 2022 and 2023 has been further revised downward.On the one hand, global inflation continued to register increases in both advanced and emerging economies,reaching, in some cases, the highest levels in several decades and, in most cases for a prolonged period of time,above the targets of their respective central banks.Inflation has been driven by a more generalized increase in prices, in addition to pressures in the food and energysectors, in an environment in which imbalances between demand and supply continue to exist in various markets.World economic activityIn this context, Banxico added, a large number of central banks continued to raise their benchmark rates, in somecases at a faster pace than anticipated.Financial markets continued to register episodes of volatility and risk aversion, as well as conditions of hightightening, in an environment that saw a significant strengthening of the dollar against a large number of advancedand emerging economy currencies and an increase in yield rates during most of the period, although in somecases this trend has been partially reversed.On the other hand, the purchasing managers' indices (PMI) for the manufacturing and services sectors point to aweakening in the third quarter.This trend reflects factors that have affected both the demand side, due to elevated inflationary pressures and lowerconsumer confidence, and the supply side, due to persistent disruptions in supply chains and higher productioncosts.Although there has been a recent decrease in the prices of some raw materials and in disruptions to supply chains,particularly a decrease in shipping costs, these factors remain at high levels."
Aug 2022;"Global economy struggles as Europe may fall in recession - Capital";"The outlook for global economic growth remains downside, while Europe is expected to fall into recession, Trendreports, citing Capital Economics, UK-based research and consulting company.The company forecasts to see both some renewed increase in bond yields and weakness in ""risky"" assets over therest of this year.Capital Economics agrees with the idea that US inflation will fall quite sharply over the next 1-2 years, and that thiswill eventually allow the Fed to move to a rate cut. However, the agency expects the Fed funds rate to reach aslightly higher peak, and the easing cycle to begin later.Regarding the correct pricing for bond and equity markets, and the US inflation to be brought back around its targetmuch needs to be done, Capital Economics said.""Investors seem to be of the view that a sharp but short-lived tightening cycle - with the Fed funds rate rising to apeak of approximately 3.75 percent in early 2023, but being cut quite rapidly from around the end of the first quarter- will be enough to bring US inflation back to around the Fed's 2 percent target. Judging by the recent resilience ofanalysts' expectations for corporate earnings, and the gains in equity markets, many appear to be anticipating thata sharp Fed pivot will also limit the damage to the economy. This may help to explain why the S&P 500 hasrebounded of late even as the US Treasury yield curve has continued to invert,"" the report added."
Aug 2022;"OPEC further lowers forecasts for global economy and oil demand in 2022";"VIENNA, Aug. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Thursday furtherrevised down its forecasts for this year's global economic growth and oil demand, following a previous downwardrevision in May.The oil alliance said in its monthly report that the world economy is expected to grow by 3.1 percent in 2022,compared to its forecast of 3.5 percent in the previous three months. Explaining the downward revision, OPEC cited""weaker second-quarter growth in the major economies and an observed soft trend in some key economies."" In itsMay report, OPEC had already lowered its forecast for global economic growth this year from 3.9 percent to 3.5percent. This projection was maintained until July. Risks facing the world economy include ongoing geopoliticaltensions and supply chain issues, the continued COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, high sovereign debt levels inmany regions, and expected monetary tightening by central banks in the United States, Britain, Japan and the eurozone. The oil-producer group has also forecast that global oil demand will average around 100 million barrels perday (bpd), down from the previous months' estimate of 100.3 million bpd. The revised oil demand forecast is due to""expectations of a resurgence of COVID-19 restrictions and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties"" in the second half ofthis year. According to OPEC's August report, some of its members have continued to struggle with meeting theirmonthly output quotas. Nigeria and Angola fell significantly behind their production targets in July, the reportshowed. Enditem"
Sep 2022;"Diesel Supply Crunch Upends Jet Markets";"An overstretched downstream continues to support diesel prices, even as worsening global economic prospectsundermine crude and other refined products including jet fuel. Oil consumption normally ebbs during the winter butsky-high natural gas prices could add 1 million barrels per day to already-peak seasonal demand for diesel-typeheating fuels this year, according to Energy Intelligence estimates. The surge in buying comes ahead of the EU'sFebruary 2023 embargo on Russian products and the scramble to replace around 500,000 b/d of diesel. The importban is set to clash with peak refinery maintenance in the US making the potential supply crisis even worse. Somerespite could come from China which has just issued 15 million tons of product export quotas to the end of this year.International benchmark ICE Brent lost $1.97 per barrel over the week to finish at $88.49/bbl Thursday while NymexWest Texas Intermediate shed $2.26/bbl to close at $81.23/bbl. Markets are now bracing for a new phase in theRussia-Ukraine conflict, as well as the outcome of next weekâ€™s Opec-plus meeting. Observers predict theproducer group, which includes Russia, will want to cut more than the symbolic 100,000 b/d reduction agreed at thelast meeting. The coalition's goal may not be so much to reinvigorate prices, but to calm volatility. Tradersincreasingly think Russia will fail to keep its oil flowing once EU import bans take effect. Moscow has yet to respondto G7 plans to cap crude and product export prices. Current plans are for two product price caps, one for premiumproducts like diesel and jet fuel and another for discounted fuels like naphtha and fuel oil. European jet cargodifferentials plummeted as bumper imports continued to arrive far too late for the summer season and at a timewhen everyone wants diesel instead. Jet cargoes were assessed at an $8 per metric ton discount to pumped upICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures at Thursdayâ€™s close compared to a $16.25/ton premium to the screen forultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) cargoes. ""These are Covid-style levels,"" says a leading jet trader. ""But that's whathappens when you have no diesel,"" he adds. Seasonal airline buying is falling at the same time that marketbackwardation means there is no incentive for traders to build up jet storage. Jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp dipped to a three-week low of 778,000 tons on Sep. 29, according to Insights Global, even as parallelgasoil stocks rose to their highest level since January. Tanker-tracker Kpler puts jet fuel arrivals at 2 million tonsthis month, the highest since March 2020, with market sources suggesting another 1.7 million tons or more willarrive in October. Volumes are being beefed up by a surge in very long-haul jet traffic from South Korea and China.Jet fuel ought to end up in Europeâ€™s diesel pool like it did during the pandemic, ""but you can only blend if youhave something to blend it with,"" warns a trader. The week saw two jet cargo deals. European major BP bought two30,000 ton parcels from Swiss trader Glencore in Tuesday's market-on-close window. BP paid a $20/ton premiumto the average of Platts' c.i.f. cargo mean (CCM) assessments between Oct. 12-31 for fuel arriving into RotterdamOct. 14-18 then CCM plus $3/ton pricing Sep. 28-30 for fuel arriving into Le Havre Oct. 16-20. Glencore began thereporting week offering jet into Rotterdam at a $38/ton premium to October LSGO futures but had dropped itsasking price to October plus $3/ton by Thursday. BP has been absent from the buy side since Tuesday's dealshaving dominated recent bidding. Rivals suggested that had also removed a key market support. US jet fuelmarkets posted a massive surge at midweek as higher basis diesel futures combined with spiking differentials topropel average quotes up to $3.65 per gallon. Buying interest on the Gulf Coast took off with the switch to a newpipeline cycle and drove jet spreads up to 14-year highs of 35Â¢/gallon over the November print before they settledback to 8Â¢ on Thursday. Cash values gained 60Â¢/gallon in just two days. New York Harbor spreads took off evenfurther to 58Â¢ over October diesel futures, signaling a prompt supply shortage. Differentials in Chicago and LosAngeles jumped to 23Â¢ and 33Â¢, respectively, putting jet fuel prices above diesel in every region. With hurricaneIan causing widespread destruction across Florida and the southeast, jet demand is likely to take a hit from airportclosures. Sales in the week ended Sep. 23 had soared by 660,000 b/d to 1.9 million b/d â€ their highest level sincelate December 2019. At the same time production fell to a six-month low of 1.5 million b/d. That imbalance took ahuge bite out of stocks, which plunged by 2.4 million barrels to 36.8 million bbl. The Gulf Coast accounted for mostof the drop even though exports also fell by 75% to just 108,000 b/d. Refiners are running flat-out but will be hard-pressed to replenish jet supplies at a time when maintenance shutdowns and closure of BPâ€™s 160,000 b/d Ohioplant after a fatal fire have cut capacity. The entire facility is now off line with no timeline for restart. Outages in theMidwest mean East Coast markets will need to import more, competing with Europe for barrels. Asian jet marketsweakened despite resurgent air traffic in aviation markets East of Suez. A total of 100,000 bbl of mid-October-loading jet traded from Sep. 23-29 in the Platts Singapore trading window. The volumes were sold in one lot byVitol to Trafigura at a premium of 30Â¢/bbl to Singapore quotes on Sep. 23. That sent Singapore spot pricedifferentials tumbling by 84Â¢/bbl to a premium of $1.59/bbl to Singapore quotes. It subsequently recovered to apremium of $2.04/bbl for a 39Â¢/bbl drop from a week ago. Higher air traffic in Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia andSouth Asia swamped a decline in the Middle East and gave a lift to prompt jet demand. China showed the largestincrease of 8% in scheduled capacity as lockdowns were lifted, according to data analysis firm OAG. European Quarterly Jet Fuel Swaps Quotes (Bid/Offer Range in $/ton, c.i.f.

Sep 2022;"Record inflation, slowing growth make the global economy unstable";"Moody's says any policy error or increased hazards will boost the danger of a worldwide recession in the comingyear. (AFP)Bangalore Moody's Analytics cut its global growth prediction for 2022 to 2.7% from 4.2% in January,citing stagflation concerns. Record-high prices and slowing GDP have made the global environment morevulnerable, it added.It forecasts worldwide growth of 2.3% in 2023, down from 3.6%.Moody's Analytics said in its report Global Outlook: Worldwide Economy on Edge that while the global economywill rise in 2022, any policy blunders or extra risks would enhance the likelihood of a global recession in thefollowing 12 months.'Stagflation risks have grown globally, but it will take months to materialise...Business morale is low while the global economy avoids recession 'report: agency.Negative supply shock from Russia-Ukraine war is global growth's biggest risk this year, it said. Geopoliticalconcerns in Taiwan, lockdowns in China, the cost-of-living problem, rising borrowing rates, and energy shortages inEurope show the global economy's fragility 'report:US, China, Japan, India, and the UK all perform unevenly. The Russia-Ukraine war's negative supply shockremains the biggest risk to world GDP this year, it warned. “Results will continue to differ until 2023 due to differenttrade and investment links between Russia and Ukraine, especially in energy goods 'said.Accelerating inflation worldwide has heightened stagflation threats, although it would take months to materialise andits likelihood varies by area and country.We define stagflation as CPI inflation at least 1 percentage point over the central bank's equilibrium objective, anunemployment rate at least 1 percentage point above the natural rate, and a six- to 12-month persistence of theseconditions 'reportedMost major economies meet some of these characteristics, mainly pricing pressures, but not labour marketweakness and general persistence.According to the analysis, Europe is very prone to stagflation, with the UK having the greatest risk."
Sep 2022;"Resurgent Demand and Supply Expand US Jet Fuel Trade Flows";"US jet fuel trade flows have so far been unfazed by the European rush to secure mid-distillate supplies ahead ofupcoming EU sanctions on Russian fuel . But that could change if European refiners reduce jet yields in favor ofdiesel. Resurgent US exports reflect the post-pandemic recovery in jet fuel demand across the Americas and highrefinery throughput. Refiners have stepped up runs to capture stellar margins for middle distillates, doubling jetexports to 171,500 barrels per day in the first six months versus the same period last year, according to new EnergyInformation Administration (EIA) data. A 24% rebound in US jet fuel demand to 1.530 million b/d in first-half 2022also lifted jet fuel imports by 50% to 122,500 b/d in the same period, despite higher output from domestic refiners.Very little of the export volume went to Europe in first-half 2022, but those flows may increase as sanctions andlower refinery yields widen Europeâ€™s jet fuel deficit. In recent years only the UK and Netherlands have importedUS jet fuel, but their intake dried up during the pandemic. The UKâ€™s imports resumed in the second quarterwhen it took three US cargoes. The Netherlands imported one cargo in March. Insufficient refining capacity acrossmuch of Latin America and the Caribbean confines most US exports to the Americas. Mexico and Canada imported45% of those shipments in the first six months. Mexico kept its travel market open during the pandemic andbecame the largest customer for 55,000 b/d. Canada fell into second place as reduced airline demand limited its USsupplies to 23,000 b/d. Smaller volumes went to Panama, Peru, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic and otherislands in the Caribbean. Israel takes regular shipments of military-grade jet fuel under a long-standing contractwith the US Department of Defense, with imports totaling 5,300 b/d in the first six months. Balancing Act The USimports jet fuel to balance markets on the East and West Coasts when price spikes emerge or regional productionlags demand. The West Coast typically takes two-thirds of the volume, since the East Coast also relies on theColonial Pipeline for deliveries from the Gulf Coast. Asiaâ€™s export powerhouse South Korea remains the topsupplier of 69,000 b/d with a 40% share of total US imports, as traders ply a major route across the Pacific to theUS West Coast. Some Korean supplies move onward via the Panama Canal into the fast-growing Florida market.That arbitrage has been more economical over the last five years after expansion of the Panama Canal in 2016made way for larger cargoes and reduced shipping costs. Refiners in Japan and Canada accounted for the secondand third largest shares of 12,000-13,000 b/d to fuel airports along the East and West coasts. Kuwait boosted itsshipments to 6,500 b/d in the first six months, after downstream restructuring expanded its jet fuel production. TheUAE, Saudi Arabia, China and Taiwan sent small volumes. India provided a rare cargo but could appear morefrequently on the supplier list as its refineries use discounted Russian Urals crude to boost their exports. Jet fuel isstill a tiny component of total US refined product exports, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine inFebruary. US product exports have averaged 6.1 million barrels per day since March, up from 4.8 million b/d in thehalf-year before that, EIA data shows. Most of its 1.1 million b/d of diesel exports have gone to Latin America,where Mexico, Chile and Brazil are key buyers. But US diesel traffic to Europe jumped 35% in the first six months to53,000 b/d, according to EIA data. More jet fuel shipments could also move trans-Atlantic in coming months.

Sep 2022;"Markets Crumble on Demand Destruction Fears";"Oil prices have fallen to their lowest level since before Russia's invasion of Ukraine as fears of demand destructiontook a heavy toll. Benchmark Brent fell below $90 per barrel for the first time since February. Losses of more than$3/bbl on the week sent alarm bells ringing at Opec-plus with the alliance reasserting its intent to be â€œattentive,pre-emptive and proactiveâ€ in supporting market stability. But price volatility may be out of its control.G7 countries have engaged in a power play with Russia over its 5.7 million barrels per day of crude and refinedproduct exports. A deep economic recession is looming in Europe with the impact already being seen on energyconsumption. Chinese demand is also weak with Beijing's zero-Covid-19 policy forcing around 25% of Chinaâ€™seconomy into lockdown. International benchmark Brent fell $3.21/bbl or 3.5% on ICE to finish the week at$89.15/bbl Thursday while low-sulfur gas oil futures on the same exchange rose 2.3% to $1,075 per metric ton. WTIfell $3.07/bbl to $83.54/bbl on Nymex. G7 countries want to keep Russian oil flowing while reducing the amount ofmoney going to Moscow to fund Putinâ€™s illegal war. The market has warned that capping oil or gas prices iswishful thinking. Moscow has already threatened to cut off anyone supporting the price cap with supply shortagesset to boost oil prices by up to $20/bbl. Cynics say the EU will end up buying re-routed Russian crude from othersellers to fill the gap. European jet fuel cargo differentials collapsed as a wall of September imports began to arrivetoo late for the peak summer season. A hefty 1.7 million metric tons of fuel is set to arrive from the Mideast Gulfand Asia this month, the highest monthly total seen since before the pandemic. The figure includes multiple verylong-haul shipments from South Korea loaded back in July. They are set to arrive just as airlines are switching tolighter winter flight schedules and facing the prospect of much lower passenger demand. Northwest Europeancargoes were pegged at just a $13.75 per ton premium over front-month ICE LSGO futures at Thursdayâ€™sclose, down sharply from $52.25/ton at the end of last week. Firmer gasoil futures meant flat jet fuel prices fell farless than crude despite the dramatic move in differentials. Europe's gasoil market is set to become more detachedfrom crude as the region scrambles to replace banned Russian diesel imports from February next year. Latest jetfuel arrivals in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp included the LR2s STI Puma bringing fuel from the United ArabEmirates and Pacific Anna carrying fuel from Kuwait and Bahrain, and the LR1 Ust Luga with soon-to-be bannedRussian jet onboard. Jet tanks in ARA recovered from their recent two-and-a-half year low as a result, reaching771,000 tons on Sep. 8, according to Insights Global. ARA jet tanks are still down 25% on last year but 8% higherthan this time in 2019. Jet tankers from India and Kuwait also arrived in the UK this week and from South Koreainto northern France. Russian jet has mainly headed to Turkey since major oil companies and airlines began self-sanctioning after Moscowâ€™s invasion of Ukraine with only occasional tankers going into ARA tanks most likelyfor re-export. US jet fuel markets stabilized following their steep slide last week as Nymex diesel futures found afloor at $3.54 per gallon. Jet spreads narrowed on the Gulf and West Coasts to offset some of that loss, puttingaverage jet prices at $3.33/gallon. Day-to-day volatility in August has given way to more stable cash values in the$3.31-$3.46 per gallon range. Re-opening of BPâ€™s 440,000 b/d Whiting refinery in Indiana after a fire willreplenish supplies in the Midwest, with Chicago differentials sinking to 13Â¢/gallon below October diesel futuresfrom a 1Â¢ discount last week. With oil prices falling faster than products, crack spreads have recovered back to$63 for diesel and $55/bbl for jet fuel. Airlines were still drawing down stocks from the surge in jet fuel deliveriesaround Labor Day that drove demand back to 2019 levels. Sales plunged by 400,000 b/d in the week ended Sep. 2to 1.43 million b/d, their lowest level since early July. Lower air traffic flows heading into the fall travel seasonshould put a damper on jet sales in coming weeks. Production dropped by 72,000 b/d to 1.57 million b/d â€ the firstslide below 1.6 million b/d since early April. Imports also took a nosedive to 24,000 b/d or just one-quarter of theirAugust volume. Asian jet markets continued to defy the losses in Europe and the US despite weaker promptdemand. Singapore differentials jumped to a premium of $3.66/bbl to Singapore quotes before receding to$2.65/bbl on Sep. 8 for a 21Â¢/bbl gain from last week. A total of 310,000 bbl of jet loading by early Octoberchanged hands in the Platts window. Saudi Aramco sold 210,000 bbl on Sep. 6 at a $1.80/bbl premium toSingapore quotes to PetroChina. Aramco went on to sell another 100,000 bbl at a $1.70/bbl premium to Vitol onSep. 8. Prompt jet demand came under pressure from a major decline in China's air traffic. Scheduled airlinecapacity in Northeast Asia dropped 10% from the previous week amid new lockdowns that spurred a 14% dive inChina, according to data analysis firm OAG.

Sep 2022;"Shell believes jet fuel demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels by 2024";"U.S. aviation fuel demand is back to 2019 levels.Global aviation fuel demand is expected to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels of 300 million tons per year in thenext one to two years, Shell's aviation chief said Tuesday.Demand in the United States has returned to 2019 levels, while consumption in Europe has recovered by more than80% and is on track to fully recover in the next year, Shell Aviation president Jan Toschka told Reuters on thesidelines of the 38th Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC).""Asia has had a bit of a bumpier ride, with markets opening and closing, but overall we expect Asia, in particular, topick up in the next year, but it could be another year before we see the full potential of the market,"" he said.However, jet fuel supplies are tightening in Europe with the upcoming entry into force of European Union sanctionson Russian oil products, causing the region to import more fuel from the United States, China, India and the MiddleEast.""The market needs to buy from refineries further afield (...) Shipping and rail and all kinds of distribution are undermore stress now with this new kind of (trade) routes,"" Toschka said.Shell is looking at building two more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants in the United States as it targetsrenewable fuel to account for 10% of its global jet sales by 2030, Toschka said.The company could also make a final investment decision for its SAF plant in Singapore in late 2022 or early 2023,which is expected to come online in 2026 with up to half a million tons of SAF produced in the city-state, he said.Meanwhile, its Rotterdam biofuels plant is expected to start production in 2024 or 2025, Toschka said. ""We willhave more than 2 million tons of PBS annually by 2030,"" he noted."
Sep 2022;"Balancing act";"Brent crude oil futures slipped below $90/bbl in early September, the lowest level since January and more than$34/bbl below a June peak. This is the largest 90-day decline since March-April 2020 and is only exceeded prior to2020 by market routs in 2014-15 and 2008-09. Yet, diesel and jet fuel markets remain exceptionally tight, asreflected in current pricing.For now, a deteriorating economic environment and recurring Covid lockdowns in China continue to weigh onmarket sentiment. Nevertheless, world oil demand is forecast to grow by 2 mb/d in 2022 and 2.1 mb/d next year.Jet fuel dominates growth, while road transport demand wanes. Robust oil use for power generation in the MiddleEast and in Europe due to record natural gas and electricity prices is providing additional support.At the same time, more oil is hitting the market. IEA member countries released nearly 180 mb of governmentstocks from March through August, with a further 52 mb scheduled for the next two months. Moreover, world oilsupply increased by 790 kb/d in August to 101.3 mb/d - up more than 5 mb/d on a year ago. Russian oil productionand exports have proved resilient, with August levels only 400-450 kb/d below pre-war levels. Despite a 2 mb/ddrop in Russian crude and oil products shipments to Europe, the US, Japan and Korea since the start of the year,the rerouting of flows to India, China, Türkiye and others has mitigated upstream losses.However, the EU embargo on Russian crude oil and product imports that comes into effect in December 2022 andFebruary 2023, respectively, is expected to result in deeper declines. An additional 1 mb/d of products and 1.4 mb/dof crude will have to find new homes. An EU ban on maritime services may force further reallocations from thirdcountries not agreeing to the proposed G7 price cap. Russian total oil production is forecast to decline to 9.5 mb/dby February 2023, a 1.9 mb/d drop compared to February 2022.Such losses would still leave the market oversupplied in 2H22, by close to 1 mb/d, and roughly balanced in 2023.But product markets, especially diesel, are expected to remain in deficit due to downstream capacity constraintsoutside of China. Global diesel markets have tightened this year, with demand robust and as lower Chinese exportquotas have sharply reduced its sales abroad. More recently, newly introduced taxes in India have discouragedexports from Asia's largest supplier.The EU has so far largely maintained Russian diesel import volumes at around 600 kb/d, but from next Februarythese volumes will need to be replaced by other sources. Three large refinery projects in Kuwait, Nigeria andMexico coming online by the end of 2023 will eventually increase global diesel availability. The proposed price capmechanism would also need to work in order to assure overall diesel supply for the global market is met and sothat European importers can switch to flows from the US, Middle East and India. Failing that, and assuming Russiawill not be able to ship diesel in significant quantities outside the price cap, European, Latin American and Africanimporters could be competing for a rather smaller pool of available flows.GraphicGraph, Demand/Supply Balance"

Sep 2022;"OPEC Upbeat On Global Economic Growth";" September 15 -- Global economic growth is set to remain robust at 3.1% this year and another 3.1% next year,OPEC said on Tuesday in a forecast suggesting that the cartel expects healthy oil demand growth despite marketfears of recession.In its September Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) published today, OPEC made no changes in its economicgrowth estimates and sounded an upbeat note about the trend of the global economy for 2022 and 2023.The cartel expects the global economy to grow by 3.1% both this year and next, and although it revised down itsestimate of the Eurozone economy, OPEC still sees 3.1% growth in 2022 and 1.7% increase in the euro area in2023. That's contrary to recent forecasts from analysts and economists who expect the Eurozone and several EUmember states to be plunged into recessions as early as this year due to soaring energy prices weighing oninflation, industries, and consumer sentiment.""Economies like India and the Euro-zone showed a strong growth dynamic in 1H22, compensating very well for therelatively - and likely temporary - weaker performance of the US and China,"" OPEC said in its MOMR on Tuesday.Looking at 2023, the cartel noted that ""Despite the obvious downside risks, there is also upside potential to theglobal economic growth forecast.Fiscal measures in the EU and China support growth towards the end of the year and lead to the potentialcontinuation of a stable dynamic in 2023.""As a result of the expected robust economic growth, oil demand will continue to rise, especially driven by therecovery in travel and transportation, OPEC said. This is forecast to lead to robust overall growth in oil demand of3.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022 and 2.7 million bpd in 2023, surpassing the pre-COVID-19 levels, to standat an average 102.7 million bpd next year."
Sep 2022;"Broad Slowdown Grips Global Economy";"While a wane in the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year gave the global economy a temporary boost, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s economic outlook sees a slowdowncontinuing into the coming year.The OECD recently released its global economic outlook, which found that the world economy is slowing morethan anticipated and expected to remain subdued through the end of the year. Annual growth for 2023 is expectedto be just 2.2 percent, and global GDP is projected to be at least $2.8 trillion lower in 2023 compared to December2021 forecasts.One of the biggest factors contributing to this decline is the continuing war in Ukraine, which has put additionalpressure on prices in multiple sectors, including food and energy. On top of that, generalized tightening of monetarypolicy, driven by greater-than-expected overshoot of inflation targets, has also slowed growth.Continued shutdowns in China due to the country's zero-Covid policy have impacted not only its economy, but theglobal economy, as well. China's growth slowed to just 3.2 percent in 2022.The United States lagged even further behind in real GDP growth projections for 2022 at 1.5 percent, which isanticipated to slow to just 0.5 percent in 2023. Saudi Arabia leads year-over-year growth projections at 9.9 percentin 2022, but is still projected to see that growth decline to 6 percent next year.And while broader inflationary pressures have been seen in the U.S. for much of 2022, areas like Europe and to alesser degree, Japan, are starting to feel the pinch. More than half of the items in the price index show inflationabove 4 percent in the United Kingdom, the U.S. and the Euro area, reflecting a sharp increase compared to a yearbefore and more than doubling their targets.With unemployment rates at or close to 20-year low in many countries, tight labor market conditions have boostedwages-particularly in the U.S., U.K., and Canada-Band helped mitigate the loss of purchasing power and growth.But OECD said this labor market also is contributing to broad-based inflation.OECD predicts inflation will peak in the current quarter in most major economies and decline in the fourth quarterand in 2023 in most G20 countries. That said, the organization expects inflation will remain well above central banktargets around the globe in 2023.While the U.S. is expected to see more progress in inflation reduction due to early monetary policy tightening, theU.K. and Euro zone will lag behind with elevated headline and core inflation over the coming year. Lookingelsewhere, China has enjoyed low and stable inflation while Brazil and Mexico are expected to see inflation relief asthey raise interest rates. Countries such as Turkey and Argentina are expected to continue to see high inflationrates in 2023, though levels should be slightly lower than in 2022.Energy source disruption also plays a major role in OECD's economic outlook. As the war in Ukraine continues,supplies from Russia and the European Union continue to see major disruption. And unless countries make asignificant effort to reduce consumption, the situation could get exponentially worse.Gas storage levels in the European Union have been raised to almost 90 percent of capacity, but even at this level,OECD said there may not be sufficient gas storage to ensure that demand in a typical winter can be met withoutdepleting storage to dangerously low levels if the European Union fails to reduce gas consumption. Shortfalls couldincrease significantly if additional non-Russian supplies from outside the European Union fail to materialize or if aparticularly cold winter increases demand.OECD said that without energy supply diversification and demand reduction, shortages could boost global energyprices, require temporary rationing and negatively impact confidence and financial conditions. These impacts couldreduce European economy growth by more than 1.25 percentage points in 2023 and raise inflation by more than1.5 percentage points. This increase would push many European countries in to recession in 2023. And worldwide,inflation could be pushed up by more than a half a percentage point in 2023 with growth reduced by just under ahalf a percentage point.With lingering issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing disruptions of the war in Ukraine and recordinflation contributing to a stagnated global GDP in the second quarter and output decline, OECD said the globaleconomic outlook remains difficult for the foreseeable future."
Oct 2022;"Diesel Dislocation Continues";"East of Suez jet fuel tankers are starting to divert away from Europe to the US in search of higher prices. Europeanairline fuel demand is flagging at the start of the winter off-season and amid fears the regionâ€™s cost-of-livingcrisis could soon dent passenger demand for flights. Network manager Eurocontrol this week warned that theeconomic hardship caused by Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine has already pushed European aviationâ€™s Covid-19recovery back another year until at least 2025. Regional air traffic was almost 88% of 2019 levels in the week toOct. 19, according to Eurocontrol data, having failed to get above 90% all summer.Tanker tracking shows multiple vessels carrying jet from India and Kuwait diverting to New York Harbor in recentdays. Northwest European jet cargoes were pegged at a $15 per ton discount to inflated front-month NovemberICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) futures at Thursdayâ€™s close, down from a $31.75/ton premium a week ago.Ongoing French refinery strikes have pushed Europeâ€™s already-desperate diesel market into unchartedterritory, driving up the prompt gasoil benchmark and distorting jet fuel trade. Efforts to switch from Russia to Eastof Suez suppliers are already disrupting Europeâ€™s diesel trading dynamics and exposing major fuel supplychain shortfalls. Diesel margins currently outstrip jet by $26/bbl. The week saw three jet cargo trades with Swisstrader Glencore on the sell side of all of them. Glencore sold twice to European heavyweight BP: once into theUKâ€™s Isle of Grain Nov. 7-11 at a $29/ton premium to the Platts c.i.f. cargo mean (CCM) in Mondayâ€™swindow, and again into Rotterdam Nov. 7-11 at CCM plus $15/ton Thursday. Glencore also sold to Swiss traderVitol into Rotterdam Oct. 28-Nov. 1 at a $9/ton premium to November ICE LSGO futures in Tuesdayâ€™s window.Imports from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and South Korea pushed jet tanks in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp to a six-month high of 872,000 tons on Oct. 20, according to Insights Global. Divergent fundamentals have created hugeanomalies in regional jet fuel markets across the US. Basis diesel futures fell throughout the week to close at$3.76 per gallon on Thursday. Jet fuel spreads plummeted on the Gulf and West coasts but soared in New YorkHarbor. That dynamic led to sharp variations in cash rates, which ranged from $$3.18 to $4.12/gallon. Los Angelesdifferentials plummeted to a whopping 90Â¢/gallon below the November print, down from a 10Â¢ premium just 10days earlier. Gulf Coast spreads were positive at the start of the month but had receded to a 45Â¢ discount by latelast week. Disparities mask a relatively balanced market. Jet demand continues to fall from its summertime highs,losing another 110,000 b/d to settle at 1.4 million b/d as air traffic ebbs during the fall shoulder season. Refinerskept production around 1.5 million b/d to focus on diesel supplies which yielded an $82/bbl profit for Gulf Coastplants. Jet fuelâ€™s crack spread at $68 was more than double the $30 for gasoline. Delta Air Lines is benefitingfrom strong downstream earnings. The Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery operated by its Monroe subsidiary posted a$192 million profit in the third quarter, nearly double the $97 million earned in the year-earlier period. Largearbitrage jet flows toward the West of Suez spurred a strong rebound in Asian markets, even as regional air trafficstarted to ebb. The benchmark Singapore spot price differential spiked by $1.91/bbl from a week ago to a premiumof $2.29/bbl to Singapore quotes on Oct. 20, its highest level in nearly a month. A total of 4.8 million barrels ofarbitrage jet loaded or are scheduled to load from Oct. 17-27 from South Korea, India and China, according toKpler. The volumes are pointed at Europe, the US West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii and are expected to arriveduring November. Another 842,000 bbl of arbitrage jet are loading from Oman and Saudi Arabia on Oct. 22 andOct. 30, respectively, the Kpler data show. They are headed to Europe with expected arrival dates in mid-November.

Oct 2022;"IMF chief sees 'darkening' outlook for global economy";"Oct 06, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com/ Delivered by Newstex) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) will next week downgrade its forecast for 2.9 percent global growth in2023, Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, citing rising risks of recession and financialinstability.Georgieva said the outlook for the global economy was 'darkening' given the shocks caused by the COVID-19pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine[1] and climate disasters on all continents, and it could well get worse.'We are experiencing a fundamental shift in the global economy, from a world of relative predictability to a worldwith more fragility — greater uncertainty, higher economic volatility, geopolitical confrontations, and more frequentand devastating natural disasters,' she said in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.Georgieva said the old order, characterised by adherence to global rules, low interest rates and low inflation, wasgiving way to one in which 'any country can be thrown off course more easily and more often.'She said all of the world's largest economies — China, the United States[2] and Europe — were now slowingdown, which was dampening demand for exports from emerging and developing countries, already hit hard by highfood and energy prices.The IMF would lower its 2023 growth forecast from 2.9 percent, its fourth downward revision this year, when itreleases its World Economic Outlook next week, she said. The global lender would leave its current forecast for3.2 percent growth in 2022 unchanged, she said and gave no number for the new 2023 forecast.The war in Ukraine and global economic risks will dominate next week's annual meetings of theIMFand the WorldBank in Washington, DC, which bring together finance ministers and central bankers from around the world.The IMF estimates countries accounting for about one-third of the world economy will see at least two consecutivequarters of contraction this year or next, Georgieva said.'And, even when growth is positive, it will feel like a recession because of shrinking real incomes and rising prices,'she said.Overall, theIMFexpects global output to shrink by $4 trillion between now and 2026. That is roughly the size of theGerman economy and amounts to a 'massive setback,' she added.Global divisionsGeorgieva said the division of the global economy into blocs that are either supporting Russia, opposing it, or'sitting on the bench' following its invasion of Ukraine would wind up reducing important efficiencies and hurtingpoor people the most.'We cannot afford the world to break apart,' she said. 'If we go to a point where we cut off parts of the world fromeach other, it will be the poor in rich countries and it will be the poor countries that will bear the brunt of the impactof it.'Uncertainty remained high and more economic shocks were possible, she said, warning that high debt levels andliquidity concerns could amplify the rapid and disorderly repricing of assets on financial markets.Georgieva said inflation remained stubbornly high, but central banks should continue to respond decisively, even ifthe economy slowed down.Inflation is stubbornly high, but central banks should continue to respond decisively, the International MonetaryFund said on Thursday[File: Francesca Volpi/Bloomberg]She told CNBC in an interview that US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was walking a 'very, very narrow'path in shaping monetary policy, but the IMF expected interest rates to be 'somewhere in the 4 percent territory' in2022 and 2023.'If he doesn't tighten enough, inflation may de-anchor. If he tightens too much, there could be a recession. So JayPowell is doing his best to watch the parameters in the economy to calibrate what he does, and I trust that he willmake the right call,' she said.Fiscal measures adopted in response to high energy prices should be targeted and temporary, she saidin thespeech.'In other words, while monetary policy is hitting the brakes, you shouldn't have a fiscal policy that is stepping on theaccelerator. This would make for a very rough and dangerous ride.'The United Kingdom this week reversed plans to cut taxes for the richest,[3] which had sparked market turmoil anda sharp rebuke from the IMF, that warned the country's financial plans risked increasing inequality and were atcross purposes with tightening monetary policy.Asked on CNBC about theIMF's criticism of UK policy, Georgieva said, 'This is a message we convey toeverybody.'Georgieva urged greater support for emerging markets and developing countries, noting that high interest rates inadvanced economies and the strong dollar[4] had triggered capital outflows. The probability of portfolio outflowshad risen to 40 percent.She also called on China and private creditors — who hold the lion's share of global debt — to address the risk of awidening debt crisis in emerging markets.

Oct 2022;"Air fares to fall in November as government lowers fuel surcharge";" Filipinos planning to travel for the holiday season can expect air fares to go down next month, as airlines vow toreduce ticket prices with a lower fuel surcharge in place.Local carriers Philippine Airlines (PAL), Cebu Pacific and AirAsia Philippines yesterday said they would comply withthe directive of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to cut the fuel surcharge for November.PAL spokesman Cielo Villaluna said the airline would slash the fuel surcharge, which would be reflected in ticketprices in November.'We are pleased to comply and we shall implement the adjustments to our fuel surcharge in line with the latest CABdirective. The adjusted fuel surcharge applies to tickets to be purchased in November,' she said.Cebu Pacific chief commercial officer Xander Lao said the budget carrier would abide by the CAB's order to bringdown the fuel surcharge by a notch in November. In turn, passengers can expect ticket prices of the Gokongwei-ledairline to go down as well.'We look forward to the lower fuel surcharge, which should help make fares more affordable and stimulate air travelas we get nearer to the Christmas season,' Lao said.AirAsia Philippines spokesman Steve Dailisan said the drop in fuel surcharge would drive demand for air travel,particularly for the upcoming holidays.'For instance, this lowers the fuel surcharge cost to the metro cities of Cebu and Davao to P503 and P708, fromP571 and P782 this October, respectively, [thus] we are expecting the new fuel surcharge rate to drive the demandfurther,' he added.AirAsia Philippines hopes to raise its load factor to as high as 95 percent for domestic routes in the fourth quarter,meaning that at least nine in every 10 seats are booked during the period. As such, the Philippine unit of theMalaysian airline committed to introduce additional seat sales to boost demand.In an advisory, CAB reduced fuel surcharge to Level 8 for November, from Level 9 in October, to reflectmovements in the price of jet fuel. Level 8 translates to a fuel surcharge of P253 to P787 for domestic trips andP835.05 to P6,208.98 for international flights.Fuel surcharge refers to the optional fee that airlines impose to recoup fuel costs and minimize financial lossescaused by sudden surges in jet fuel rates.Fuel surcharge may be reduced or even removed by CAB depending on the price movement of jet fuel in theinternational market."
Oct 2022;"Economy 4.0 | Global economic growth: slowdown or recession?";"The European Union is facing the consequences of surrendering its industrial development to Russian oil and gas,and thus succumbing to Vladimir Putin's geopolitical game.Russia acted with patience and foresight in allowing the construction of infrastructure to connect Western Europewith the fields located in its territory: it obtained short-term economic benefits by selling the energy, but alsomedium and long-term political and military rent by closing the tap of its gas and oil in the face of the frictionsunleashed by the invasion of Ukraine. The occupation of Ukraine and the European Union is cooling off.The consequence is clear: the specter of inflation and the lack of energy resources is haunting Europe with a forcenot seen since the Second World War: Germany, France, Spain and Italy, the economic heart of the EuropeanUnion, are facing problems to keep their industry operating: green energy is not enough.The first effects are visible through the value of the euro against the dollar: the single currency has weakened tohistoric levels in the face of the certainty of a recession that is already visible in Germany's industrial contractionand rising prices.Great Britain is also facing historic imbalances: the pound sterling is losing strength against the dollar in the face ofits external account deficit and domestic political problems, a scenario not seen in 40 years.As a result, the two strategic partners of the United States in Europe are in the process of moving from a slowdownto a recession, the second in less than four years.Although it can be argued that Russia is not in the situation that was predicted in the face of the blockadeimplemented by Western countries, it is clear that the help of China and India will not be enough to avoid arecession in that country.Moreover, how long will it be possible to sustain the export of Asian industrial inputs to Russia? Part of the answerwill depend on how effectively the real estate and banking crisis within China is handled and how many resources itcan continue to channel without affecting the internal investment plans it is implementing to avoid a furtherslowdown in its economy in view of the slowdown its exports will experience: a recession in Europe and aslowdown in the United States would also hit the Asian giant.To this we must add what is already being observed in the U.S. economy: a drop in new home sales andconstruction starts, which coexist with a moderation in construction spending and an increase in mortgage costs.The manufacturing cycle is also slowing.The latter will be exacerbated by monetary policy action: almost all the world's central banks share the US FederalReserve's view that it is necessary to raise rates to control inflation. One exception is China.The expected result will be a greater restriction in aggregate demand (consumption and investment) that willincrease economic inequality: higher interest rates do not promote equality.| Global economic growth: slowdown or recession?Mexico must prepare for this future. The country is starting from a structurally limited economic growth: 1.6% in thefirst seven months of the year. Without a program to strengthen its domestic market, it may falter in the face of thestrong wave that has been incubated abroad."
Oct 2022;"IMF presents 'darkening outlook' for global economy";"International Monetary Fund Director Kristalina Georgieva said Thursday the world economy faces a darkeningoutlook brought about by shock after shock causing a global output loss of $4 trillion by 2026.The IMF has downgraded economic growth projections to 3.2% for 2022 and 2.9% for 2023. The IMF also loweredgrowth projections back in April.In a Georgetown University speech, Georgieva said there has been a fundamental shift in the global economyfrom a world of relative predictability to a world with more fragility and greater uncertainty.""In less than three years, we lived through shock, after shock, after shock,"" she said, citing global events such asthe COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's war on Ukraine and climate disasters on all continents.""These shocks have inflicted immeasurable harm on people's lives,"" she continued. ""Their combined impact isdriving a global surge in prices, especially on food and energy, causing a cost-of-living crisis.""During this period of heightened economic fragility, Georgieva said, it's vital that immediate challenges beaddressed to stabilize the world economy.The IMF believes the risks of recession are rising and urges the first priority to be staying the course on fightingworldwide inflation.Failure to do that now, she said, would likely lead to inflation becoming ""de-anchored and entrenched"". She saidthat would cause massive harm to growth and massive harm to people.Georgieva said the second global economic priority ought to be creating responsible fiscal policies to protect thevulnerable in lower-income households without fueling higher inflation. She warned against indiscriminate financialsupport across the board because she said that would make it harder to fight inflation.Longer term, Georgieva said the IMF believes that transformational reforms are needed to stabilize the globaleconomy. They include stepping up action on food insecurity, which affects 345 million people worldwide, anddeveloping much stronger cooperation in addressing the existential threat of climate change.On climate change, the IMF has created its first long-term lending tool called the Resilience and Sustainability Trustwith funding pledges of $40 billion.Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, the IMF has provided $258 billion in financial assistance to 93 countries,Georgieva said. And since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the IMF has supported 16 nations with nearly $90 billion,according to Georgieva."

Oct 2022;"Global economic growth slows down";"Global growth forecasts are slowing amid an increasingly bleak and uncertain outlook, with the world's largesteconomies stagnating and inflation running rampant. The World Bank has announced a downgrade of its globalgrowth forecast from 5.7% in 2021 to 4.5% for 2022, up four tenths from its previous estimates in June, but has cutnext year's by 1.4 points to 1.4%, well below the 2.1% estimated by the government when preparing its 2023budgets.The main new element in the Bank's forecast is the war in Ukraine, which started at the end of February and ishaving multiple effects on the global economy: higher commodity prices, more supply chain problems and greateruncertainty, among others.After the setback caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, it was anticipated that the recovery would be rapid and thatwe could reach pre-crisis levels. However, all the forecasts are now worse because of several factors that areweighing down global growth, including high inflation, which is eroding consumer purchasing power, bottlenecks inthe supply chain that are still latent, the effects of the Covid-19 crisis, which has led to the bankruptcy of manycompanies over the years, and especially the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which is further fueling pricerises, especially in energy and foodstuffs.Inflation can lead to a vicious circle from which it is not easy to escape. To cope with rising prices and decliningdisposable income, higher wages will be demanded, so employers will increase the prices of their goods andservices to cushion the rising costs, further fueling the inflationary process.All these factors are having a negative impact on the economic recovery of the world's major economies. In theUnited States and Europe, inflation is undermining consumption and investment, causing a contraction ineconomic growth, and this situation is expected to worsen due to restrictive monetary policies. China, for its part, isimmersed in its real estate crisis and there are still some confinements in some regions, which is also causing itseconomy to grow more slowly than expected.This worldwide slowdown is even bringing some countries to the brink of recession. Therefore, in the currentcontext of high inflation, the risk of entering stagflation, an economic phenomenon characterized by low growthwhile prices continue to rise, is increasing. This is considered one of the worst possible economic scenarios as it isvery complex to correct and has very adverse effects on the economy: firstly, high inflation causes households tolose purchasing power and industries to see their costs rise, causing corporate profits to fall and thus reducingaggregate consumption. Secondly, low growth (or decline) causes companies to adjust their costs, leading to higherunemployment rates, lower investor confidence and less liquidity in the system.The main solutions to the current economic problem are to reduce inflation and stimulate economic growth.However, it is difficult to achieve both objectives simultaneously through monetary policy and, given the restrictivestrategy of the Central Banks, it is most likely that first the economy will slow down and prices will graduallynormalize and, subsequently, economic growth will be stimulated through price controls. The ideal solution wouldbe to increase supply so that production increases and prices relax. However, this supply is quite rigid due toproblems in the supply chains, the major slowdown in China and the energy crisis caused by Russia. There are,however, a number of measures that, together with restrictive monetary policy, can help to reduce inflation morequickly.The most important thing at the moment would be the resolution of the war in Ukraine, which at the moment seemsunlikely, so in order to minimize the increase in energy prices, measures to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, suchas renewable energy generation or the development of energy efficiency, among others, should be encouraged. Itis also very important to solve the bottlenecks in the supply chains, the shortage of maritime containers and the lackof carriers, as this causes a negative supply shock and, therefore, higher prices. Global dependence on theChinese giant must also be reduced and the microchip crisis solved, and for all this, a series of technological anddigital solutions should be implemented to optimize the entire logistics process.On the other hand, public spending is an economic variable that contributes to price increases. Therefore, it isimportant that States control spending items, not only to contribute to inflation stability, but also because it is anecessary measure for many countries that for years have been financing such spending with debt, especiallyduring the Covid-19 crisis. So much so that many countries are currently over-indebted, especially in the currentcontext of rising interest rates. Therefore, rather than increasing public spending, incentives should be provided toincrease productivity both in public spending and in companies themselves."

Nov 2022;"'One year to get green jet fuel off the ground'; Aviation";"Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt | The Albanese government has one year to get behind a domestic green aviation fuelindustry or risk it heading offshore, Qantas and other industry players have warned.With farmers locking in long-term contracts to sell their feedstock to offshore producers of sustainable aviation fuel(SAF), the industry is calling on the government to ramp up its policy and funding support.""To start domestic production in 2025, next year has to be the year of policy formation, investment, governmentsupport, and then industry coming together,"" Andrew Parker, chief sustainability officer at Qantas, told TheAustralian Financial Review at the COP27 summit in Egypt.""We are seeing now that in Europe, the UK, Canada, Japan, all the other major markets, but particularly the US,production is either under way, or in a sophisticated state of preparedness.""SAF is made from feedstock such as used cooking oil, energy crops, forestry residues and animal tallow, which isblended with normal jet fuel. It can cut a plane's emissions by up to 80 per cent, and does not require airlines tomodify their jet engines.SAF is seen as the answer to guilt-free long-haul flying because electric and hydrogen planes are suitable only forshort-haul - prompting forecasts of exponential growth in demand and output this decade.Bioenergy Australia chief executive Shahana McKenzie said Australia could miss the chance to join the SAF rush ifits potentially plentiful feedstock supplies went offshore.""If you look at contracts that are being signed today for feedstock, they are for five to 10 years. If you look at thingslike forestry residues, you look at the canola that is currently exported overseas for renewable fuels. These are notdeals that are done on a one- or a two-year basis, they are offtakes for 10 years,"" she said.""So the risk is that if there isn't a signal to the Australian market that we are going to be developing projects in thiscountry, then we're going to see a rush of project developers seeking to secure our feedstock for other regions.""Mr Parker said if the feedstock went elsewhere, and investment and technology followed it, that would be ""astrategic loss to Australia"".Some Qantas planes have started tanking up with SAF at Heathrow in London, and will access SAF in Los Angelesand San Francisco from 2025. Page 2 of 3 'One year to get green jet fuel off the ground' AviationThe airline wants to get to 10 per cent SAF use by 2030, but 70 per cent of the airline's fuel uplift is in Australia. It isin talks to import SAF from Singapore.The government is setting up a Jet Zero Council, which Ms McKenzie said was a critical first step.""That will bring together all of the different areas of government that need to play a role - SAF is in agriculture, it's intrade, it's in industry, it's in defence, it's in energy, climate, all of the sectors you can possibly imagine. And becauseof that, it tends to fall through the cracks a bit,"" she said.The most important barrier, she said, was the amount of investment capital required.""SAF is far more expensive than traditional jet fuel. And so in markets that are rapidly progressing andaccelerating, where you are seeing billions of dollars of investment, it is in jurisdictions where there is a policyframework that is really enabling that deployment,"" she said.The global SAF industry was worth $US66 million in 2020, but is projected to reach $US15 billion by 2030.Robert Boyd, an Australian based in Geneva for Boeing's global sustainability policy team, said the size ofAustralia's jet-fuel market meant it still had a chance to deal itself into the burgeoning global industry.""A lot of countries are now competing on policy. Australia has the chance to really get active and catch up, to getback with the big pack,"" he said.Ms McKenzie said potential SAF developers were circling the market, waiting for the government's signal.""There's a bit of a race going on at the moment around five potential projects that are acutely interested in theAustralian market,"" she said.""They're doing the sums on what it would look like, around potential export of that fuel, potential feedstockavailability within different regions.""Mr Parker said there were also potential Australian start-ups."
Nov 2022;"Leaders Meet as Global Economy Faces Multiple Threats";"High inflation, food insecurity and a possible global recession loom large as the Group of 20 summit discussionsbegin.BALI, Indonesia -- World leaders gathered on Tuesday at a moment of severe geopolitical turmoil, as the globaleconomy slinks toward recession, weighed down by high inflation, a growing scarcity of food and the side-by-sidethreats of oil shock and financial crisis. President Biden and his counterparts in many of the Group of 20 nations, which include wealthy countries likeBritain and Japan and emerging markets like India and Brazil, are pushing for an aggressive and coordinatedresponse to those threats. They hope to broker agreements meant to dampen global oil prices, help emergingmarkets escape crushing debt and increase food supplies to poorer nations where the cost of grain, rice and otherstaples has spiked since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the administration's efforts have hit strong opposition from the two countries that will dominate Mr. Biden'sattention at the summit, and that can arguably do the most right now to lift the world's economic outlook: Russiaand China. Russia's war in Ukraine has been responsible for much of the economic uncertainty facing the world, and onTuesday world leaders called for ending the war and easing global conflict. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressed the G20 gathering by video link and called again on Russia --whose leader, President Vladimir V. Putin, is not attending -- to immediately withdraw its troops. Russia's foreignminister, Sergey V. Lavrov, is attending the summit in Mr. Putin's place. Repeating his demands for accountability for Russian violations of international law, Mr. Zelensky said thatUkraine would not end its resistance until its territory was restored. ''Every day of delay means new deaths ofUkrainians, new threats to the world, and an insane increase in losses due to continuation of the Russianaggression -- losses for everyone in the world,'' he said. China's leader, Xi Jinping, did not directly mention the war in his remarks at the summit but referred to a tensegeopolitical environment and disrupted supply chains for food and energy. ''All countries should replace division with unity,'' he said, according to a transcript from the Chinese ForeignMinistry. China, which has an increasingly strong partnership with Russia, has not condemned Moscow's invasion,but this month Mr. Xi cautioned against ''the threat or use of nuclear weapons'' in the conflict. It is a pivotal moment for the global economy, as rising interest rates around the world are slowing growth andheightening recession fears. The strengthening U.S. dollar is worsening the debt burdens of developingeconomies, increasing the chances that government defaults rip through the world financial system like wildfire. The International Monetary Fund, which downgraded its growth outlook last month, expects global output toremain sluggish this year and in 2023. In its latest projections, the I.M.F. forecast the global economy to grow 3.2percent this year and to slow to 2.7 percent in 2023. China's growth appears to have stalled. Countries like Britainare already entering a recession, economic data suggest. ''Hopeful signs of recovery last year were replaced by an abrupt slowdown in the world economy because ofCovid, the war in Ukraine and climate disasters on all continents,'' Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of theI.M.F., said in a speech at the Group of 20 meetings on Tuesday. The World Bank said in a separate report released on Monday that food insecurity remained a major problemdespite signs that rising food prices had eased in recent months. More than 200 million people are projected toexperience ''severe food insecurity'' in 2022. ''Domestic food price inflation continues to remain high in almost all low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries,'' the World Bank said. ''Despite decreases in global food prices since their peak in April, multiplerisks threaten the downward trend in prices.'' Mr. Biden insists that the American economy is strong enough to endure the economic crosswinds. But, as theymeet in Bali, Biden administration officials say the United States and its wealthiest allies want to act in concert withpoorer nations to soften what could be a protracted downturn -- and an especially damaging one for emergingnations. Rishi Sunak, the new British prime minister, warned in an opinion essay published in The Wall Street Journal onMonday that global leaders must find a way to restore the economic stability that has been shaken by Russia'swar in Ukraine. ''Our collective economic security has been threatened by this war. So we need to get on with the job that theG20 was created to do, in stewarding the global economy through the turbulence this act of aggression set off,''Mr. Sunak wrote. Russia has destabilized food and energy markets by invading Ukraine. A punitive European embargo of its oil thatis set to begin next month could drive crude prices skyward and slam consumers already hit hard by soaring pricegrowth. American and European officials are working to finish the details on a program that would allow Russian oilto effectively bypass those sanctions -- but only if it is sold at an even steeper discount than the one countries arealready demanding from Moscow. Negotiators are hammering out the plan's final details, including the level of theprice cap. The officials are also hoping to help heavily indebted nations avoid setting off a financial crisis. Central banks around the world are raising interest rates rapidly, in order to tame the runaway inflation that hasbeen fueled in part by supply shortages prompted by Russia's war. Those rate increases are helping to strengthenthe dollar against foreign currencies, and they are hurting countries like Sri Lanka, Chad and Ghana, which borrowin dollars to bring food, fuel and other necessities to their people. Administration officials want to push theInternational Monetary Fund to accelerate debt-forgiveness efforts as more countries come under financial pressurefrom rate increases. Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the increased strength of the dollar relative toother currencies was amplifying inflation for countries such as India, because the goods they import that aredenominated in dollars have become more expensive. ''Indians acknowledge that the Fed needs to do what the Fed needs to do, but there is some resentment that theU.S. monetary policy is creating a lot of complications for India,'' Mr. Prasad, a former I.M.F. official, said. But at the talks, it is China, a major lender to much of the developing world, that looms as the biggest obstacle todefusing such a credit crisis in low-income nations over the coming months. On Monday, Mr. Biden pushed Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, to work with the United States on debt reliefwhen they met for three hours in Bali ahead of the summit. Mr. Xi, in turn, chided Mr. Biden for a suite of economicpolicies meant to support American manufacturing at China's expense, like subsidies and tax breaks for cleanenergy and semiconductor production that were included in bills Mr. Biden signed this summer, and restrictionsaimed at choking off China's access to semiconductor technology. The Chinese description of the meeting suggested that those policies, and others meant to redirect Americansupply chains away from China, ''completely violate the principles of market economy and undermine the rules ofinternational trade.'' The American description said Mr. Xi and Mr. Biden had agreed to empower senior leaders to negotiate on debtrelief and several other issues, a possible sign of progress. Still, American negotiators have sought to work around China and Russia on economic issues ahead of thegathering, leaning on help from Britain, Germany and India, among other nations, on efforts like the oil price cap.The approach jeopardizes the traditional consensus-based efforts of the Group of 20, which was meant to bring awide range of countries together to solve global problems. In previous gatherings of Group of 20 officials this year, the usual joint statement, or ''communiqué,'' could not bedrafted. China has resisted strong language about debtors and debt, and there have been differing opinions amongthe countries about Russia's war in Ukraine. ''In October, when there was discussion of the macro outlook, many, many countries said the single mostimportant thing that we can do to improve the macro outlook is for Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine,'' Janet L.Yellen, the Treasury secretary, told reporters in Bali, adding that there was broad support for that sentiment. ''And,of course, Russia is a member of the G20, and there are other countries that are reticent about criticizing Russia, sothat's been a problem all year.'' Amid concern that slowing growth in China is dragging down the global economy, Ms. Yellen planned to ask herChinese counterparts about its zero-tolerance approach to Covid, which has included strict lockdowns, and aboutthe state of its property market, Treasury officials said. But, three weeks before the European embargo of Russian oil is set to take effect, the United States and its alliesin the Group of 7 have yet to settle on the mechanics of a price cap. The Biden administration hopes that countries such as India and China, which have been stocking up ondiscounted Russian oil this year, will use the cap as leverage to negotiate even lower prices. Ahead of the Group of20 meetings, Ms. Yellen traveled to India to meet with officials and deepen ties with the country at a pivotalmoment. However, it remains uncertain if the untested policy will be enforceable and if Russia will retaliate, sending energyprices around the world even higher. In an interview with The New York Times on her flight from India to Indonesia, Ms. Yellen said the process ofrolling out the price cap had been complicated because the European Union must unanimously agree to the price,and the 27 member states have differing views. However, she said she expected that the price would be unveiled by Dec. 5 and that the policy would be effective. ''Our motives are to hold down Russia's revenues to impede its ability to fight the war,'' Ms. Yellen said. ''And,second, to make sure that there's enough global supply of oil that global oil prices don't jump, because that wouldboth exacerbate inflation and would likely cause a recession.''https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/business/economy/world-leaders-meet-as-global-economy-faces-multiple-threats.htmlGraphicPHOTOS: An oil refinery in Moscow.

Nov 2022;"IMF sees ""gloomier"" global economic outlook";"ALBAWABA - ""Gloomier"" is the global economic growth outlook the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seesahead of the G20 summit in Indonesia.The Bali Summit, slated for November 15-16, comprises three main working sessions on food and energy security,digital transformation, and health.The countries at the G20 summit represent around 85 per cent of the global GDP and about two-thirds of theworld's population.The IMF says high-frequency indicators confirm a global economic slowdown, citing a steady worsening inpurchasing managers indices that are tracking a range of G20 economies.An IMF report titled 'G20 report on Strong, Sustainable, Balanced, and Inclusive Growth' said continued fiscal andmonetary tightening is likely needed in many countries to bring down inflation and address debt vulnerabilities.The IMF in October warned that the global economy was headed for ""stormy waters"" and ""the worst is yet tocome"".In its report the IMF said it expects further policy tightening in many G20 economies in the months ahead thatwould continue to weigh on economic activity, particularly in the interest-sensitive housing and banking sectors.""G20's evolution is associated with financial crises. It began in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1999, and adecade later it was elevated to the Summit meeting in 2008 which again was a year of crisis in Europe andAmerica. Its decision to commit spending worth $4 trillion to revive economies and efforts to avert tradeprotectionism in 2008-9 contributed to financial stability in the coming years,"" Dr. Rajan Kumar, School ofInternational Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi told The Financial Express.""But its cohesion was short-term, and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 invited the specter of a new Cold War,"" he added.The global economy has weakened due to three key main factors: persistently high and broad-based inflation, theweak growth momentum in China, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The challenges that the global economy is facing are immense and weakening economic indicators point tofurther challenges ahead. However, with careful policy action and joint multilateral efforts, the world can movetoward stronger and more inclusive growth, the IMF report said.Global growth is projected to slow to 3.2 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent in 2023, necessitating tighter policystances to facilitate adjustment to the new state of the world in order to offset the persistence of multiple globalsupply-side shocks, the IMF said.""The surge in consumer prices that started last year has gathered pace in 2022, resulting in rates of inflation thathave exceeded central bank targets in most G-20 economies,"" the IMF report said.Citing the volatile new world environment, the IMF said ""the challenges that the global economy is facing areimmense and weakening economic indicators point to further challenges ahead""."
Nov 2022;"Weak inflationary effects on Armenian economy from global economy";"YEREVAN, NOVEMBER 1, ARMENPRESS. In September, 2022, the 12-month inflation in Armenia rose amountingto 9.9%. The 12-month core inflation also increased, reaching 10.5%, Governor of the Central Bank Martin Galstyansaid during a press conference.""Slowing trends of economic activity are observed in the global economy. The central banks of advancedcountries continue to significantly tighten monetary conditions. This is expressed by a certain drop in prices ininternational commodity markets, however, headline inflation in the main partner countries of Armenia is still high"",he said.The CBA Governor said that weak inflationary effects on the Armenian economy from the global economy areexpected.""In the third quarter of 2022, the trends of high activity in the Armenian economy are persisting. The economicgrowth primarily bears the positive effects of external demand, reflected as a significant increase in the servicessector. Continued increase in the inflow of international visitors and money transfers from the Russian Federationcontributes to the expanding of demand. This is also expressed in the improvement in Armenia's external balanceposition and dram exchange rate appreciation. High demand also contributes to the heating of labor market, theexpanse of overall inflationary environment and persistence of high inflation expectations. In current circumstances,the conduct of contractionary and coordinated fiscal and monetary policy is important"", the CBA Governor said.He added that a relatively tightening monetary policy and the dram appreciation will gradually contribute tocontaining demand and reducing inflationary expectations.""The Board of the CBA will be consistent in taking adequate actions to stabilize inflation and absorb any risk of de-anchoring inflation expectations. In accordance with the monetary policy scenario, the 12-month inflation willgradually decrease and stabilize around the 4% target in the medium run.The Board of the CBA estimates that the risks of inflation deviating from the projected path are mainly balanced;should such risks materialize in either direction, the CBA will respond accordingly to fulfill the price stabilityobjective"", he stated.Earlier today the CBA Board decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage point, setting it at 10.5%."
Nov 2022;"The Global Economic Instability";"At least since the Second World War, Brazilian leaders adopted the habit of blaming international crises for theBrazilian economy's mishaps or failures. During the periods in which Brazil experienced national successes,practically no ruler gave credit to the good world situation and the favorable conditions created by the internationaleconomy. This posture is understandable, as it is too much to expect politicians - at least most of them - to havethe greatness to recognize their internal errors when the domestic situation is bad and to recognize the positiveimpacts coming from abroad when the world is doing well.Taking the more recent past of two or three decades, one must remember, during the administration of PresidentFernando Henrique Cardoso, the negative effects of serious international problems, which helped to damageBrazil's economic performance; also the highly positive effects of international growth during the two mandates ofPresident Lula; and the effects of the international crisis during the Dilma Rousseff government. In the case of theLula government, the president never gave credit to international prosperity, in effect during his eight years in office,as a factor that helped moments of good Brazilian economic performance, just as Rousseff never acknowledgedher mistakes by insistently blaming the international crisis for the severe recession in her government in 2015 and2016.Brazil may fare better than several countries considered developed in the short term - but only if the electedgovernment does not fall into the temptation of populist and reckless measuresThe fact is that it has become common practice for governments to attribute their successes to themselves andblame the rest of the world when things go wrong domestically. In reality, when the world is doing well, Brazilbenefits; when the world is doing badly, Brazil is hurt and suffers the negative effects of international crises.However, being vulnerable to external problems and successes does not justify failure or success in internalperformance. Thus, one of the premises for the structuring of plans and actions aimed at bringing economic growthand social development to Brazil is that crises and global political and economic instabilities have becomecommon and routine, and they will be repeated with regularity from now on. That is, global instability and globaleconomic problems will be the norm, so that one of the national goals of government and society must be toincrease the resilience quotient in the face of imperfect scenarios occurring in the world or in part of it.With 2022 almost over, the differences between countries in overcoming the negative effects of the pandemic andthe paralysis of much of the productive activity have become clear. There is no single method to measure thisnational overcoming, but there are four indicators that should be in the formulas used for such measurement: thereorganization of the production system after the end of social isolation; the resumption of Gross Domestic Product(GDP) growth; inflation; and unemployment. The balance of these four indicators reveals that the United States is ina weak position, even suffering from high rates of inflation, something that is not common in that country; Europehas serious difficulties in moving forward and, as an aggravating factor, suffers from the difficulties in the supply ofsome highly important items, such as natural gas that used to be supplied by Russia; Latin America adds to theproblems already mentioned the old and well-known political instability; and China is limping along with old crises,such as the collapse of the real estate system, fragilities in the banking system, and fatigue with the ups and downsof lockdowns, to the point where street protests have begun to challenge the iron hand of the communistdictatorship.In this panorama, although bitterly affected by the pandemic, in comparative terms Brazil is having reasonable GDPgrowth, inflation is relatively under control, unemployment has started to decrease and, despite the severe watercrisis that lasted until recently, agribusiness has been performing expressively. In this sense, the Brazilianeconomy is in a good relative situation and social inequalities have been eased with the reformulation of the BrazilAid. In such a context, Brazil may do better than several countries considered to be developed and start to recoverits economy with a view to concluding this third decade with a much better performance than the previous decades- but only if the elected government does not fall into the temptation of populist and reckless measures. Theproblem is that Lula has been signaling in exactly the opposite direction, betting on the explosion of public spendingin order to fulfill campaign promises such as maintaining the R$ 600 family allowance and increasing the minimumwage in real terms. When the negative results of the complete abandonment of fiscal responsibility come in, it willcome as no surprise if the blame is again placed on a problematic global scenario."
Nov 2022;"OPEC economists anticipate global economic uncertainty";"While growth has been better than anticipated from the world's leading economies, a global slowdown is expectedto develop during the last few months of the year, OPEC economists said Monday.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries released its monthly market report for November onMonday, before the start of the trading day on Wall Street. OPEC economists left all of their forecasts for economicgrowth in place for this year and next, but said it would be anything but smooth sailing.""The world economy has entered a period of significant uncertainty and rising challenges in the fourth quarter,""economists wrote. ""Downside risks include high inflation, monetary tightening by major central banks, highsovereign debt levels in many regions, tightening labor markets and persisting supply chain constraints.""Last week's reading on U.S. inflation came in better than expected, with so-called core inflation -- which strips outvolatile items such as food and energy -- at 6.3% during the 12-month period ending in October. Month-on-monthand core inflation increased 0.3% from September, better than the 0.6% increase during the prior period.OPEC economists said that even though some economies were performing better than others, ""a gradualslowdown is expected to materialize"" during the fourth quarter. As such, economists kept global growth forecastsunchanged for both this year and the next.The global economy is expected to expand by 2.7% this year and by 2.5% in 2023. The United States, the world'slargest economy in the world, should grow by 1.5% this year and slow to 0.8% by next year. China's economyexpands by 3.1% this year and grows another 4.8% next year, the only major economy expecting an expansionover 2022 levels.Among the major economies reported on by OPEC economists, only Russia is on pace for a contraction this year.OPEC expects negative 5.7% growth for 2022 and a recovery to 0.2% next year.Russia's revenue is quickly evaporating due to Western sanctions imposed in response to its war on Ukraine. Bynext month, European buyers will no longer purchase waterborne crude oil from Russia.That could lead to some supply-side challenges in the future. The OPEC forecast for producers working outside ofits umbrella was unchanged at 1.5 million barrels per day in new output next year. OPEC's own production is onpace to post only a very minor increase by next year.But given the myriad of concerns from OPEC economists, global demand for crude oil next year was revised lowerfrom the previous month's forecast by 100,000 bpd to stand at 2.5 million bpd."
Nov 2022;"OECD: global economy expected to slow in 2023 and recover slightly in 2024";"The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released a report Tuesday in which it saidit expects the global economy to slow further next year, ""as the massive and historic energy shock unleashed bythe war in Ukraine continues to spur inflationary pressures, undermining household confidence and purchasingpower and increasing risks around the world.""Thus, the organization expects the global economy to grow ""well below expected pre-war outcomes"" - by amodest 3.1% this year, before slowing to 2.2% in 2023 and recovering moderately to a still below average pace of2.7% in 2024.""Growth in 2023 relies heavily on the major Asian emerging market economies, which will account for nearly three-quarters of global GDP growth next year, with the United States and Europe decelerating sharply,"" the documentsays.With regard to inflation, the OECD predicts that it is likely to remain high in the OECD area, at more than 9% thisyear. However, ""as tighter monetary policy takes effect, demand pressures and energy prices ease, and transportcosts and delivery times continue to normalize, inflation will moderate gradually to 6.6% in 2023 and 5.1% in 2024.""""The global economy is facing serious headwinds. We are dealing with a major energy crisis and risks continue topoint to the downside with lower global growth, high inflation, weak confidence and high levels of uncertainty,making it very challenging to successfully navigate the economy out of this crisis and back to a sustainablerecovery,"" concluded OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann."
Nov 2022;"More trouble ahead for the global economy, OECD predicts";"High interest rates, soaring inflation and Russia’s war in Ukraine mean that slower growth is predicted for theglobal economy in the year ahead -- with only a slight recovery in 2024.According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the world economy will growjust 3.1% this year, down sharply from 5.9% in 2021.And next year is expected to be even worse: The international economy will expand be only 2.2%, says the Paris-based organisation.The West will be particularly affected. GDP in the Euro area and growth in the US are expected to decline to 0.5%.""The world is facing substantial headwinds and substantial risks over the horizon"", explained OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann.""In this challenging environment we need to confront the crisis with well-designed responses as well as withinternational cooperation in order to overcome this difficult situation and pave the way for a better future"", he added.Soaring high inflation is dragging on economies around the world. In the Eurozone, inflation next year is expectedto drop to 6.8% from 8.3% in 2022.The incremental drop in prices in the US may continue, with inflation falling to 3.5%. Further easing is anticipated in2024.""Inflationary pressures have really intensified and have become a lot more pervasive"", said Alvaro Santos Pereira,Acting Chief Economist at the OECD.""You can see that in many countries of the world you have more than 50%, 60%, 70% of all goods and services oftheir economies that right now are growing more than 6% per year."" he said. ""So, inflation has become moreentrenched, more intensified, but also more broad-based""."
Nov 2022;"Europe to bear the brunt of global economic growth";"TEHRAN- The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says the global economy isfacing significant challenges. Growth is losing momentum, high inflation has broadened out across countries, withEurope to be hit hardest in the global slowdown as the Ukraine war ""provokes a massive energy price shock notseen since the 1970s.""According to the intergovernmental organization, high inflation has not only broadened out across countries andproducts but is also proving persistent.It says energy supply shortages could push prices even higher and with interest rates increasing it has called ongovernments of the necessity to curb inflation and heighten financial vulnerabilities.OECD says the Ukraine war has seen energy prices skyrocketing and is taking a heavy toll on the world economy,which will worsen if European gas storage runs short. This could force rationing in Europe, hurting countriesworldwide as global gas prices are pushed higher.With spot electricity prices generally being linked to the price of gas, the marginal source of electricity generation,record-high gas prices have meant similarly extreme wholesale electricity prices in Europe.As a result, economic growth is forecast to be lower than expected and prices higher in Europe and worldwide.Retail energy prices have increased much less than wholesale prices, especially in Europe.As Europe bears the brunt of the Ukraine war, the European Union's business activity has taken a hit with theconflict seeing an energy price spike. The organization has forecast that the 19-country eurozone economy wouldgrow by only 3.3% this year and then slow to 0.5% in 2023.The OECD has predicted a contraction of 0.3% next year in Europe's strongest economy Germany, whoseindustry-driven economy is highly dependent on Russian energy exports.Outside the eurozone, the British economy was seen shrinking by 0.4% next year as it contends with rising interestrates, surging inflation, and weak confidence. Previously the OECD had expected 0.2% in growth.China, which is not an OECD member, was one of the few major economies expected to see growth pick up nextyearThose exports have been sanctioned by the West and the move appears to have backfired on households acrossEurope who are facing skyrocketing gas bills this winter. This comes amid what the organization has labeled as theworst energy crisis since the 1970s which will trigger a sharp slowdown.Labour market conditions generally remain tight, but wage increases have not kept up with price inflation,weakening real incomes for workers despite the actions taken by governments to cushion the impact of higher foodand energy prices on households and businesses.Tighter monetary policy and higher real interest rates, persistently high energy prices, weak real household incomegrowth, and declining confidence are all expected to sap growth. The United States and Europe are slowing sharplyand the major Asian emerging-market economies are expected to account for close to three-quarters of globalGDP growth in 2023.The uncertainty about the outlook is high, and the risks have become more skewed to the downside and moreacute. The projections reflect the toll taken by high energy prices over the next two years, but outcomes could beweaker still if there are energy supply shortages in global markets that raise prices further, or if enforced rationingis required to lower gas and electricity demand sufficiently during the next two European winters.The OECD's economic outlook paints a grim picture.Its general assessment suggests the global economy is facing mounting challenges with financial conditions thathave tightened significantly, amidst the unusually vigorous and widespread steps to raise policy interest rates bycentral banks in recent months, weighing on interest-sensitive spending and adding to the pressures faced by manyemerging-market economies.""We are certainly projecting a period of pronounced weakness,"" OECD head Mathias Cormann told a newsconference to present the organization's latest Economic Outlook.Global prospects are also becoming increasingly imbalanced, with the major Asian emerging-market economiesaccounting for close to three-quarters of global GDP growth in 2023, reflecting their projected steady expansion buton the other hand, it has predicted sharp slowdowns in the United States and Europe.To tackle higher inflation, many central banks in the West have hiked interest rates in an effort to curb the cost-of-living crisis.But the OECD says higher policy interest rates could also slow growth by more than projected, with policy decisionsdifficult to calibrate given high debt levels and strong cross-border trade and investment links that raise thespillovers from weaker demand in other countries. Widespread and rapid monetary tightening also heightensfinancial vulnerabilities.This is while slowing growth and rising interest rates have weighed on equity markets in most advancedeconomies.It argues that continued monetary policy tightening is needed in most major advanced economies to anchorinflation expectations and lower inflation durably.The organization says better government support to help cushion the impact of high energy costs on householdsand companies is needed.The war in Ukraine as well as the Covid pandemic have added to the longstanding challenges for growth,resilience, and well-being from the acceleration of digitalization, population aging, and the need to lower carbonemissions.Effective and well-targeted reform efforts are required to enhance productivity and skills, reduce inequality andimprove gender balance, strengthen resilience and boost living standards, the OECD reported.Well-chosen policies, such as increased support for childcare and reduced tax wedges for lower-paid workers,could help to address the current pressures faced by lower-income households and also offer medium-term benefitsfor employment and inclusion.In many Western countries, the UK is the latest, critics say the government has taken the opposite measures byimposing higher taxes on struggling households, which include those from middle-class backgrounds, who are nowfeeling the squeeze of inflation.The OECD also touched on the fallout from the Ukraine war saying it remains a threat to global food security,particularly if combined with further extreme weather events resulting from climate change.It has called on better international cooperation to address emergency food needs and strengthen domestic supply.Stronger international cooperation on debt relief, including through the G20, is also necessary to minimize thepotential adverse economic and social consequences, with a rising number of lower-income developing countriesalready experiencing debt distress and having fragile banking sectors.The unexpected persistence of inflationary pressures this year owes much to the outbreak of the war in Ukraine,which resulted in an immediate spike in a number of key commodity prices - for oil, gas, and coal, a range ofmetals, wheat, and corn, and some edible oils, as well as fertilizers.Also, while wage growth has picked up in most economies, it has not kept pace with inflation, resulting in a sharperosion of wages in real terms in many OECD economies.In essence, the report says the war in Ukraine (on the backdrop of recovery from the Pandemic) is having apersisting adverse effect on economic conditions. Global GDP stagnated in the second quarter of 2022, with sharpfalls in output and a contraction of output with Europe hit harder than expected but the United States and otherdeveloping countries were affected as well.This spells misery for families across the West and beyond while adding to the growing calls for Westerngovernments to help lay out peace initiatives and end the crisis in Ukraine."
Nov 2022;"Global economic outlook for 2023 remains unclear";"It's been a miserable year for the global economy. But things can always get worse. History says the Federal Reserve's high-speed interest-rate hikes may well tip the United States into recession in2023. Few will be surprised if spiralling natural gas prices do the same for Europe. The double whammy of zeroCovid-19 and a property slump threatens to bring China's economy to a near standstill. And in an extreme downside scenario, all those things happen at once. That could wipe out some US$5 trillion(S$6.9 trillion) in global output, compared with more upbeat forecasts at the start of 2022, according to BloombergEconomics. But there are positive surprises that could stop the rot in 2023. The Fed might pull off the fabled soft landing withthe labour market proving resilient. Warm weather could spare Europe a recession. China may opt for an early exitfrom lockdowns. And even if those prove to be false dawns, investors who see a top for interest rates and a bottom for growth mightstart betting on the recovery to come. Still, after years marked by plague, war and scarcity, it's hard to be optimistic.Here's a guide to the biggest economic risks for the year ahead. The great rate squeezeThe Fed's benchmark interest rate is poised to hit 5 per cent in early 2023, up from zero atthe start of 2022. The most aggressive monetary tightening in decades is already hurting America's economy, andthe world's. There's more pain to come. With higher borrowing costs hammering rate-sensitive industries from property to autos, Bloomberg Economics isforecasting a recession in the US in the second half of 2023. More than two million Americans will likely lose theirjobs. Things could turn out better, if inflation disappears as quickly and mysteriously as it arrived. But it's more likelythey'll turn out worse. The pandemic has thrown labour markets out of whack, pushing what economists call thenatural rate of unemployment -- the level of joblessness required to keep inflation under control -- above where it'sbeen in recent years. If that's happened in the US, and Fed chairman Jerome Powell says it's a possibility, the central bank might haveto raise rates as high as 6 per cent, tipping the world's biggest economy into a longer and deeper recession. Debt risks are backSo long as growth rates were higher than borrowing costs, public debt came cheap.Governments piled it on. The total owed by the Group of Seven developed economies rose to 128 per cent ofgross domestic product (GDP) in 2022, from 81 per cent in 2007. Now, with economies slowing and interest rates rising, the calculus is shifting -- and the bill is looming. Severalmajor economies could find themselves on an unsustainable debt trajectory unless they make painful fiscaladjustments. Investors are watching Italy, where debt-service costs are set to rise to 7 per cent of GDP by 2030, from 3 per centin 2019. Italy probably won't default. But avoiding that outcome could require a European-level fix, typically afraught process. British bond markets pulled back from the brink after former prime minister Liz Truss' failed attempt at a fiscalsplurge. But closing the gap in public finances, and preserving credibility with investors, will require painful budgetausterity.The US isn't quite in the same category. Even so, a looming debt-ceiling debate -- amplified by the Republicans'midterm gains -- will keep markets focused. Housing looks vulnerableTight money means it's crunch time for housing markets worldwide. Countries likeCanada and New Zealand -- which rank among the frothiest housing markets based on metrics like the price toincome ratio -- may find themselves on the front line.The US isn't at the top of the risk rankings, but it's close. It will take a 15 per cent drop in nationwide prices to bringmortgage payments in line with household incomes.China's problems are everyone's problemsFor China, the base case is that reopening the economy after zeroCovid-19 will offset the drag from real estate, with the net effect being slightly stronger growth. BloombergEconomics forecasts 5.7 per cent for 2023. Risks are tilted firmly to the downside. It remains unclear when -- and how -- the Chinese government will end itszero Covid-19 strategy. Bloomberg Economics calculations suggest property construction has to fall 25 per cent torealign with shrinking supply. What's more, the looming retirement of top economic officials could leave Chinese President Xi Jinping with ateam that's short of crisis-fighting experience. Failure on both these fronts could take Chinese growth all the waydown to 2.2 per cent. If property crash segues into financial crisis, even that number will be out of reach. A slowdown that sharp would send shockwaves around the world. The biggest blow would fall on China's Asianneighbours, from South Korea to Vietnam, and major commodity producers like Australia and Brazil. Europe's energy tightropeThe final piece of the global risk puzzle is the world's polarisation into rival camps, whichis already imposing steep costs on Europe. Support for Ukraine after the Russian invasion has left the continent with natural gas shortages and soaring powerprices. Bloomberg Economics' base case is that high energy costs and rate hikes by the European Central Bankwill tip the bloc into recession, with GDP shrinking 0.1 per cent in 2023. With some luck (good weather) and skill (policies that channel scarce gas supply to the right places), Europe mightdodge a downturn. Without either, the economy could tip into a contraction comparable to that seen in the globalfinancial crisis. Crude has dropped from a war-driven peak of close to US$130 a barrel in the first half of 2022. Some combinationof new sanctions on Russia, reviving demand in China and supply cuts from Opec could push it back up in 2023,opening another front in the energy crisis -- in Europe and beyond -- and adding fuel to the inflation fire.The other thingsOf course, there are risks that don't fit neatly into any of these buckets. A new, deadlier variant ofCovid-19 would be a devastating blow. The recent floods in Pakistan -- affecting 33 million people and tipping the economy into a steep contraction --show the impact of extreme weather events that are expected to become more frequent as global temperaturesrise. One potential upside, for financial assets at least, is that investors look forward. If they can discern a peak for Fedinterest rates, and a bottom for Chinese growth, they might drive market rallies by betting on a brighter future --even if the present looks bleak.Which, in 2023, it probably will.

Dec 2022;"Goldman Sachs predicts a cooling global economy for decades to come";"In a framework of strong uncertainty regarding the behavior of the economy in 2023, Goldman Sachs outlines aforecast for 2075 in which it identifies four major central themes: potentially slower global growth (averaging justunder 3% per year) - leveraged by a population whose growth is expected to reach 0% precisely in 2075; the abilityof emerging economies led by the powers of Asia to converge - with Indonesia emerging at the expense of Braziland Russia; the end of a decade of US expansionism, ""which is unlikely to be repeated"" and less global inequality,but more local inequality.For Goldman Sachs, ""global growth slowed from an average of 3.6% per year to 3.2% per year prior to the Covidpandemic, affecting both developed and emerging economies. It reflected a combination of slower globalpopulation growth and weaker productivity growth"" against a backdrop of a ""slowdown in the pace of globalization.""In the 'Global Economics Paper' dated December 6, the consultancy predicts ""global growth averaging 2.8%between 2024 and 2029 and on a gradually declining path thereafter"" - which will be due to ""demographics"": ""theglobal population is expected to peak at 10 billion people"" at a time when previous projections referred to 11 billion.It's not all bad: ""global population control is a necessary long-term condition for environmental sustainability. Butthere is the other side of the coin: ""this adjustment to weaker population growth and consequent population agingpresents a number of economic challenges (mainly rising health care and pension costs.And Goldman issues a warning: ""the number of emerging and developing countries for which population agingrepresents a serious economic challenge is likely to rise steadily over the coming decades.ConvergenceOn the other hand, and still according to Galdman Sachs, ""the convergence of emerging economies remainsintact, led by the Asian powers"" - with their ""growth continuing to outpace that of developed countries. The pace ofthis convergence has slowed slightly compared to the 2000s, but is significantly faster than in previous decades.""As of 2011, the consulting firm recalls, ""China, India, and Indonesia have slightly outperformed our then-8 forecasts,while Russia, Brazil, and Latin America have generally fallen significantly short of those projections."" As aconsequence, ""global GDP will shift further towards Asia over the next 30 years. By 2050, our projections implythat the five largest economies in the world will be China, the United States, India, Indonesia, and Germany (withIndonesia replacing Brazil and Russia among the largest emerging economies."" The consultancy also says that""Nigeria, Pakistan and Egypt, with the right policies and institutions, could become some of the largest economiesin the world.""The end of the American dream?With the 'emerging emergence', Goldman Sachs anticipates that the United States will be among the most affectedeconomies. ""An exceptional US decade is unlikely to be repeated. ""The potential growth of the United Statesremains significantly lower than that of major emerging markets, including China and (especially) India. In addition,the exceptional dollar exchange rate in recent years"" is not likely to be maintained, says the consultant.In this framework, Goldman Sachs says that globally, ""there will be less inequality, but more local inequality.""""Twenty years of development of emerging economies and convergence has resulted in a more equal distributionof global income,"" which ""has been a benefit of globalization over the past 20-25""-and will tend to continue.""However, while income inequality between countries has fallen, inequality within countries has increased. And, asgovernments are responsible, this has been a powerful handicap to ending inequality. ""This presents a majorchallenge to the globalization process,"" Goldman concludes.The consultant identifies, on the other hand, major global risks that will impact all countries, whether emerging ordeveloped: ""protectionism and climate change."" ""The future is uncertain, especially over the long term. Of the manyrisks our projections identify, we see two as particularly important for global growth and income convergence.""At a time when the European Union is complaining that the United States is protecting its (electric) auto industry,Goldman Sachs says ""the first risk is populist nationalism, leading to greater protectionism and a reversal ofglobalization. Populist nationalists gained power in several countries and supply chain disruptions during thepandemic resulted in a greater focus on on-shoring.""For now, the global system has held up: there has not been a reversal of globalization, but only a slowdown. Butthe risk is there: ""the risk of a reversal is clear. Globalization has been a powerful force in reducing inequalitybetween countries, but to ensure that it continues to do so, greater efforts are needed.""As for the risk of environmental catastrophes, Goldman Sachs ""rejects the view that economic growth andenvironmental sustainability are incompatible."" It was already known, but the consultancy says that ""many countrieshave managed to 'decouple' economic growth from carbon emissions, so there is no practical reason why thisshould not be achievable for the global economy as a whole."" There are those who doubt it, especially since, aseveryone knows, only poor, very poor, or impoverished countries do not have massive carbon emissions.""Achieving sustainable growth requires economic sacrifices and a globally coordinated response, and both will bepolitically difficult to achieve,"" says Goldman Sachs."
Dec 2022;"Diesel Demand Drives Oil Prices Higher";"Oil prices surged as fuel switching from expensive natural gas continued to stoke global demand for diesel/gasoil.Industrial activity has held up surprisingly well despite continued fears of a global recession. Global gasoil deliveriesrose by 520,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2022, according to the International Energy Agency,""exceeding expectations in all regions."" Europe remains a hotspot, with the agency now expecting gas-to-oilswitching to add 550,000 b/d to European gasoil demand until the end of March.It comes as the EU prepares to ban imports from its main overseas diesel supplier Russia from Feb. 5. Gasoilprices outstripped gains in crude by two-to-one with Europeâ€™s benchmark ICE low-sulfur gasoil (LSGO) contractup almost 15%, versus a sub-7% gain in Brent futures on the same exchange. International benchmark Brentended the week $5.06 per barrel higher at $81.21/bbl, while US price-pin West Texas Intermediate gained $4.65/bblto close at $76.11/bbl. Prompt diesel supply fears and ICEâ€™s Dec. 9 ban on Russian fuel from its physicalsettlement process have twisted the LSGO market into backwardation. Jet fuel differentials rose slightly onrenewed buying with cargoes pegged at a $68.25 per metric ton premium to front-month ICE LSGO futures, up from$66.25/ton a week ago. Traders are worried that Europeâ€™s looming ban on Russian diesel imports will disruptthe regular flow of jet from the Mideast and Asia next year just as Chinaâ€™s scrapping of its zero-Covid-19 policycould revive its aviation sector. A boom in Chinese domestic demand would also jeopardize growing jet and dieselsales to Europe. The week saw just one jet fuel cargo trade: Swiss trader Vitol sold 30,000 tons to US refinerValero into the UKâ€™s Milford Haven Dec. 24-28, at an $80/ton premium to January ICE LSGO futures. It wasValeroâ€™s first appearance in the pricing window since May 2020. Jet fuel tankers discharged in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) from China and Russia this week, pushing jet tanks in the trading hub to an eight-monthhigh of 930,000 metric tons on Dec. 15, according to local monitor Insights Global. Russia has been exporting asmuch fuel as possible to the EU while it still can: Mainstay diesel sales are higher than before Russiaâ€™sinvasion of Ukraine. ARA jet tanks are now 7% above year-earlier levels and 38% above where they were at thistime of year before the pandemic. Some jet could be used for diesel blending with already-sluggish airline demandnow threatened by spreading industrial action. Regional air traffic was 16.4% below pre-pandemic levels in theweek to Dec. 15, according to Eurocontrol, down from barely a 10% deficit last month. In the US, colder wintertemperatures, a stoppage on the Keystone pipeline and more buoyant diesel and heating fuel futures contrived topush oil prices above a key technical level. While distillate prices keep rising, shipping analysts say that cleantanker rates are also on fire due to limited tonnage. Those capacity issues could cause severe bottlenecks inFebruary, when the EU ban on Russian refined products takes effect. The Nymex January diesel contract tacked ona massive 59Â¢ per gallon to close at $3.28 on Thursday, signaling a tidal change in market sentiment. Outright jetquotes soared back into the $3.03-$4.28/gallon range, well above 30-day averages. Jet fuel deliveries in the weekended Dec. 9 bounced back to 1.76 million b/d, a gain of 377,000 b/d from the prior week. But demand is poised fora drop this week after widespread snowstorms crippled air travel across the Midwest and Northeast this week. Thespike in demand took a bite out of US stocks, which dipped by 1.5 million barrels to 36.5 million bbl. A revival inprompt jet fuel demand helped bolster Asian jet markets. Benchmark Singapore spot price differentials rose by26Â¢/bbl to a premium of $1.78/bbl to Singapore quotes on Dec. 15. Scheduled airline capacity for the week ofDec. 12 spiked by 20% in Northeast Asia due to a 31% surge in China, according to data analysis firm OAG. ButOAG cautioned that â€œthings change quickly in China and there has been minimal movement in internationalcapacity.â€ Domestic services have recovered to pre-Covid-19 levels and comprise 98% of China's airline capacity.

Dec 2022;"Global economy in steep slowdown: World Bank";"New Delhi, Dec. 20 -- The World Bank on Tuesday said that Global economy is in a steep slowdown.While speaking about growth in its report, 2022 in Nine Charts, it said, ""The global economy is now in its steepestslowdown following a post-recession recovery since 1970 - with global consumer confidence already suffering amuch sharper decline than during the run-up to previous global recessions.""The world's three largest economies-the United States, China, and the euro area-have been sharply slowing.Under the circumstances, even a moderate hit to the global economy over the next year could tip it into recession,it added.The World Bank in its report also said that an increase in the severity of natural hazards continues to illuminate thesocial and economic impacts of climate change.While education losses, global inflation, disruptions in supply chains, and other global challenges that the effectsof the COVID-19 pandemic continue to linger, it said.Stating that 2022 was marked by a drastic rise in food insecurity around the globe, it said, the war in Ukraine, highinflation, supply chain disruptions, and the global economic downturn all combined to drive large price increasesfor many agriculture products and inputs, such as fertilizers.Earlier, the World Bank slashed its China growth forecast for the year as the pandemic and weaknesses in theproperty sector hit the world's second-largest economy. In an official statement, the World Bank said that it slashedits forecast to 2.7% from the 4.3% predicted in June. It also revised its forecast for next year from 8.1% down to4.3%.The slowdown in China comes as the global economy is battered by surging interest rates aimed at fightingrunaway inflation that has been triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine as well as global supply chain snarls.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Dec 2022;"Global economy in slowdown?";" As economies throughout the world continue to grapple with the challenges brought about by the repercussions ofthe Russia-Ukraine war, global interest rate shocks, long-term ramifications of Covid-19, and natural disasters,China's economic slowdown has sparked additional fears.Given the country's deep integration with the world economy, any significant internal financial crisis is bound tosend shockwaves to the rest of the world, particularly to developing countries and emerging market economies.Over the past 40 years, China witnessed remarkable economic growth. Following Beijing's landmark reformsinvolving liberalizing trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) and bringing market incentives to the agricultural andmanufacturing sectors, the country recorded a yearly average real growth of 9 per cent and 13 per cent duringseveral peak years. However, in recent times, China's period of growth appears to be on a downward trajectory.This economic slowdown has resulted from a combination of several factors - the majority of which are home-grown.While the rest of the world gradually returned to normalcy, the Chinese government has been the last one thatcontinues to maintain a strict anti-Covid regime, which relies on a zero-Covid strategy aimed at detecting andeliminating virus cases before they spread. This has taken a massive toll on the country's economy, leading tobusiness closures, reducing investor confidence and consumer consumption, and using up resources.Moreover, the recent real-estate crisis, which was also partly augmented by the zero-Covid policy, added fuel to fireas the property sector accounts for 24 per cent of the country's GDP. The crisis was driven by the Chinesegovernment's clampdown on borrowing by developers beginning in August 2020, which left the debt-ladendevelopers without cash to complete the construction of pre-sold properties and led many mortgage-holders toboycott their mortgages.Additionally, in recent times, major Chinese tech companies have been reporting massive losses, attributed toCovid controls, the introduction of tough regulatory measures, and the US-China tech war. The latter has led majorChinese technology firms to be placed on the export blacklist by the US and restricted Beijing's access tomanufacturing tools and chips used to make semiconductors. Thus, it is no surprise that the World Bank hasforecast the Chinese GDP to grow by 2.8 per cent in 2022, while the IMF estimated it to grow by 3.2 per cent. Formonths, economists and scholars have warned that a slow-motion financial crisis is unfolding in the country.Given China's level of integration with the world economy, it would be a folly to assume that the impact of anyfinancial crisis in the People's Republic would remain limited to the Chinese mainland only. Research shows that inthe scenario of an adverse financial crisis, advanced economies outside the US would suffer a GDP decline of?approximately 1.5 percentage points, while emerging markets as a group would suffer a drop of 2-3 percentagepoints. Of the emerging markets, the hardest hit economies would be those highly dependent on exporting toChina.In particular, the GDP decline in the commodity-exporting emerging markets would amount to three percentagepoints in two years. On the other hand, in the scenario of a severe financial crisis similar to the American housingbubble burst of 2006, the emerging market economies altogether would see their GDP decline by approximatelysix percentage points. The impact would be akin to the effects of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007. Arguably,GDP decline could be even higher under the present circumstances as countries struggle to recover from a seriesof crises and the global economy stands at a critical juncture with the fears of recession looming.Hence, it would not be an overstatement to contend that the fate of the world economies today remains partlydependent on Beijing's ability to bring its economic slowdown to a halt, and eventually reverse its course. In recentdays, some relaxation of Covid restrictions and introduction of a rescue package for the property sector, involvingmeasures such as credit support for over-leveraged property developers, is a welcome development and wouldprovide some respite to the distressed economy. However, any meaningful relaxation of the zero-Covid policy doesnot appear in sight and will continue to weigh heavily on the economy. Moreover, tech regulation remains in place,and the US-China tech war continues unabated.Policymakers in Beijing and Washington need to realize that their policies have implications for the world's eightbillion people - all worthy of respect and consideration as the long-forgotten moral ideal of cosmopolitanism asserts.Hence, any domestic and international policies they adopt should be cognizant of global implications."
Dec 2022;"Economic slowdown: World Bank sounds alarm about global economy";"Link to ImageTerming 2022 as the worst year for poverty reduction in about two decades, the World Bank in a report has saidthat the global economy is in a steep slowdown.The international financial institution rued that as many as 685million people could be living in extreme poverty as of 2022-end.The report said that education losses, globalinflation, supply chain disruptions, and other global challenges remind us that the pandemic effects are still there.""The global economy is now in its steepest slowdown following a post-recession recovery since 1970 - with globalconsumer confidence already suffering a much sharper decline than during the run-up to previous globalrecessions,"" the report said.The US, China, and the Europe have been sharply slowing. Under the circumstances,even a moderate hit to the global economy over the next year could drag it into recession, the multilateral financialinstitutional said.The World Bank on Tuesday cut its growth forecast for China to 2.7 percent for the year as theCovid pandemic and slump in the property sector hit the world's second-largest economy, AFP reported.The World Bank in June forecast 4.3 percent growth for China. It also revised its forecast for next year from 8.1percent down to 4.3 percent.Meanwhile in its report, the World Bank also said that an increase in the severity ofnatural hazards continues to illuminate the social and economic impacts of climate change.Stating that 2022 wasmarked by a drastic rise in food insecurity around the globe, the report said, the war in Ukraine, high inflation,supply chain disruptions, and the global economic downturn all combined to drive large price increases for manyagriculture products and inputs, such as fertilizers.""By the end of 2022, as many as 685 million people could beliving in extreme poverty - making 2022 the second-worst year for poverty reduction in the past two decades (after2020),"" it said.It also stated that the past year saw the debt crisis facing developing countries intensify with some 60percent of the world's poorest countries either in debt distress or at risk of it."
Dec 2022;"Coping with a changing global economy";"At the outset, I wish my readers and all a happy and blessed Christmas!For a lot of Filipinos, Christmas this year will be a lot better than last year. Last year, 2021, was still a time of tightCOVID regulations, the country being in some form of lockdown or other.This year, many things have normalized or are normalizing even though we still live in fear of the pandemic curse.I will discuss related topics today.Inflation rate likely to stabilize. From one perspective, this year is one of return to economic normalcy were it notthat inflation has been a thorny problem.Last year began with modest inflation at less than four percent year-on-year. However, in ensuing months, inflationcrept upwards and became severe especially in the fourth quarter. In October, it was 7.7 percent and in November,eight percent, both year-on-year.The Philippine inflation rate tracked the worsening global inflation. Among many factors, the Ukraine war unsettledthe world price of food and energy. The war is still around to trouble our worries.The monetary defense against rising inflation was to raise bank policy rates. This is what many national monetaryauthorities do. Like many countries, our response shadowed rate increases implemented by the US Fed.In May, the Philippine's going bank rate was 2.25 percent. Through five different policy rate increases that totaled275 basis points by Nov. 18, when the BSP raised the rate by a hefty 75 basis points, the policy rate has risen tofive percent. The effect of the rate hike left sufficient premium for the Philippines against the US bank rate so that itserved to defend the peso additionally. After deteriorating by almost six pesos to the dollar, the peso exchange ratehas moved back toward the range of 56 pesos per dollar today.Even as the annual inflation rate is highest so far this year, signs of levelling off of global inflation are here. The USinflation rate has definitely leveled off, and the current US Fed moves in December, which still raised their bankrate, is no longer as aggressive as before. This signals that while inflation will continue to be bothersome, it isgetting tamed worldwide.Still, the Ukraine war is continuing and no one knows how and when it will end. If it ends soon, it is good news forthe inflation watch.Recovery and growth. The economic recovery has been strong in 2022. The presidential elections during the yearhad provided demand impetus, but more important was strong pent-up demand that unleashed as the economywas opened after the pandemic.The third quarter year-on-year GDP growth was 7.7 percent, even exceeding the 7.6 percent of the second quarter.These numbers indicate that the government's economic target of growth for 2022, which is set within the range of6.5 to 7.5 percent, is easily within reach.The government's infrastructure investment program continues to move on, and that is good news. The publicinfrastructure is rechristened B-B-M (or build-back better, an alliteration of the presidential initials).Some major infrastructure projects in transportation in Manila, as well as in the region are nearing completion andwill provide relief to over-stressed transport facilities. New project starts are being added to make the future morehopeful.Congress recently approved the government's budget, which supports the program of economic recovery, alongwith the required capital spending.A fragmenting global economy? The last few years remind us of trade wars between major economic powers,supply-chain disruptions, and the proliferation of geopolitical regional conflicts that is fragmenting the global worldinto economic blocs.The signs of a fragmenting global economy are showing. Advanced nations are trying to wall-in at home somestrategic industries with new incentives and domestic support programs. Although world trade will continue to rise,its direction is no longer the same as before.Trading blocs will become more dominant. This is the reality that we face even as we accept that continueddependence on trade and capital flows will benefit the Philippines in the future. In fact, our current policies are toenlarge the share of foreign investments in critical industries that are essential to the economic recovery.Are we in fully into the reforms that need to be done to accomplish the stated goals? These are some of the majorissues the present government will continue to face.Some signs show that we need a further jolt of major economic reforms in some sectors of the economy. We haveyet to reap the benefits from the liberalization of recent investment reforms to open to foreign direct investments.We hope to see some results by next year in the areas of foreign direct investment inflows in energy projects and ininfrastructure projects of large impact. Indeed, investment commitments are not easily concluded. Confidence ininvestment commitments is built on the basis of track records and on intrinsic credibility of the economic reformsthat are made.So far, statistics on FDIs have not revealed any major uptick in our economic performance on foreign investmentinflows. Perhaps it is still too early to tell or we have to improve the credibility of the policy that the country is openfor FDIs.One credible action we can undertake to show this confidence is to ratify the RCEP (Regional ComprehensivePartnership) treaty. This treaty enlarges the free trade area of the 10-member ASEAN grouping to include Japan,South Korea, China, Australia, and New Zealand. With major Asia-Pacific nations included in the RCEP, the groupbecomes the world's largest trading bloc, representing countries that comprise nearly a third of global grossdomestic product.The Philippine ratification has been awaiting approval, essentially delayed by the Senate, which ratifies internationalagreements. The hesitation to ratify the RCEP will be seen as lack of confidence in ourselves to take on a broadereconomic competition among trading nations."
Dec 2022;"Oil closes lower on global economic slowdown outlook";"Oil futures closed lower on Thursday, 8, pressured by the prospects of slowing global economy. The shutdown ofthe Keystone pipeline in the U.S., and the bottling of tankers in Turkey came to influence the business, but did notsustain high prices.On the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), WTI oil for January 2023 closed down 0.76% ($0.55), at $71.46 abarrel, while Brent for February traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) closed down 1.32% ($1.02), at$76.15 a barrel.On Thursday, the chief economist at the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Robin Brooks, stressed that theglobal economic slowdown is likely to lead to further declines in oil prices worldwide. ""The decline in oil and thetalk about the potential response (to the fuel price cap in Europe) has been a very cyclical movement, we've seenweaker demand.""Earlier in the day, oil company TC Energy reported that it has halted the Keystone pipeline in response to aconfirmed oil leak in a stream. The news breathed life into WTI oil, which traded higher during the morning, movinginto negative territory in early afternoon.Also, the number of tankers bottled in the Bosphorus straits rose from 16 to 19, Reuters reported. The bottleneck inthe Turkish Straits resulted from a dispute between a group of maritime insurers and Turkish authorities. OnThursday, Turkey said it will continue to block tankers without proper insurance letters and that it needs time tocarry out checks.In a report to clients, Oxford Economics notes that the oil cap could generate unexpected effects, even triggering arise in the price of the commodity and more power to Russia in setting oil prices.Also on investors' radar is the easing of China, one of the largest exporters of the commodity. According to a reportby CCTV, the country's state-run media, China's Premier Li Keqiang assured on Thursday that with theimplementation of optimization and adjustment measures, China's economic growth will continue."
Dec 2022;"The Global Economy Caught Between Wars and Geopolitical Conflicts";"There is a saying, ""When the US economy sneezes, the emerging markets get a cold."" The global economy nowmay be more complex: it is more resilient in terms of where new economic growth emerges, but more vulnerable interms of risk emanating from the United States, but also in China, and in sites of conflict and geopoliticalcompetition.Inflation is the immediate risk, but the outlook for shared global growth looks more uneven as the traditional driversof innovation and investment from the West now face a prolonged demographic decline, coupled with risingnationalist sentiment, and protectionist trade and industrial policies.The Covid-19 pandemic, Russia waging war in Europe, and a distrust of China's economic model all influenceWestern strategic assessments, but the trendline of growth and productivity decline has been building for sometime. In the rich world, between 1980 and 2000, GDP per capita grew annually on average about 2.25%, but in thelast twenty years that growth has halved.Challenges in the Arab regionFor the Arab region, 2023 will bring a set of new challenges to balance the opportunity of high resource revenueswith more structural inflationary pressures and a widening gap between energy importers and exporters. The upsideis that now is a tremendous moment of opportunity for some Arab states to take leadership roles in regional andglobal investment to accelerate new technologies to solve some of our most pressing energy needs.For investors, the war in Ukraine will continue to have repercussions in the global economy, whether in energyflows or food supplies. Tensions between the US and China add potential risk escalation scenarios, as well as thefailure of the Iran deal negotiations and the new reality of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. For the UnitedStates, its Middle East policy will have to change, necessitating a new kind of economic and security engagementacross the Arab region.In markets, what happens in the US and the decisions of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee willcontinue to influence global costs of borrowing.For Arab economies with currencies tied to the US dollar, the strength of the US dollar combined with higherinterest rates creates some challenges to domestic bank liquidity. For weaker Arab economies, debt sustainabilitywill be a pressing challenge to governments and will change their relations with international financial institutions, aswell as with their Gulf neighbors willing to provide central bank deposits, currency swaps, and commitments offoreign direct investment.Oil and the marketsThe economic health of the Arab region remains connected to the whims of global commodity markets, especiallyoil and gas. We don't really know the depth of the global economic slowdown ahead, or its impact on energydemand in 2023.For oil, how quickly and with what urgency can demand recover in China? The good news is that oil prices remain,for now, at levels in excess of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) fiscal and breakeven levels. Fiscal policy has beenmore constrained than in previous windfalls, and new efforts at tax collection and the growth of tourism and servicesector activity in the GCC is cushioning the possibility of a crash on the other side of this oil market swing.Perhaps more important though is the shift in external GCC assets; the breadth and scope of Gulf investment hasnever been more transformational in the global economy. One estimate by a leading investment bank sees anupside scenario where Brent oil prices rise steadily over the next three years to $120/bbl, GCC external assetscould reach a value of $6 trillion. But even with a scenario of much lower oil prices, to levels of $40/bbl, the GCCasset value flattens at a very significant level of just about $5 trillion. That's not exactly a crash in influence in adownside scenario.Global oil production is shifting as well, as the cost curve for financial and regulatory constraints changes. Thiscreates an advantage for dominant Gulf producers willing to invest in production. It also makes their politics morecomplex with members of OPEC+ and the largest global oil producer, the United States. At the same time, theoutlook for global natural gas demand has drawn Arab producers from North Africa, the Levant and the Gulf closerto Europe.Energy costsFor the Arab region, inflation and high energy costs add to broader challenges to human development, as arecent UNDP report assesses a real backtracking in development indicators. Trust in how governments canrespond to external economic challenges, whether originating from a pandemic or a global recession combinedwith inflationary pressure, remains low and deteriorating in the region.A recent Arab Barometer survey found that only 30 percent of respondents reported having a great deal of trust intheir governments as responsive to the needs of its citizens. There are some limited exceptions, however.An Edelman Trust Barometer found two countries from the Arab region - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates- among seven countries of the 27 surveyed, with high levels of public trust.Trust will be an imperative in 2023 across Arab states as governments deal with a mounting set of risk scenariosand economic challenges. In two states, Egypt and Lebanon, we see the extent of the trust deficit, from monetarypolicy to lagging reform efforts to general government disfunction.Egypt and LebanonIn Egypt, an IMF agreement on a $3 billion, 46 month extended fund facility will require more exchange rateflexibility from the central bank and the government to more actively limit its ownership within the economy, makingroom for more private sector gains. With that agreement, comes more Gulf support, which has also includedopportunistic purchases of publicly listed companies.For Egypt, any efforts to float the currency and more actively engage foreign investors on a level playing field withthe state will also require management efforts at factors outside of the state's control, such as tourism from abroad(especially Russia), energy prices and remittances. Debt management, of course, will be an ongoing stress and willnot be solved by this one IMF agreement.For Lebanon, March 2023 will mark three years since its default on external debt. There is little confidence fromcitizens or creditors on the state's ability to slow its demise. Economic activity has shrunk by half, inflation rose toan average of 200% over the past year, and the value of the currency has declined 95% of its value against theUSD. Poverty has doubled to 82% of the population between 2019 and 2021.A deal to begin exploration and production of natural gas under the sea between Israel and Lebanon marked abright spot in the ability of Lebanon to earn foreign currency from future exports, and to see some possibility oftension management among its political factions. Trust in the longevity of that agreement will also depend onfactors outside of Lebanon's control, including the policies of a new government in Israel.High interest ratesIn 2023, the threat of a global economic recession coupled with high interest rates will widen the gap of the ""havesand have nots"" within the Arab region. But more importantly, governments will be tested on their management ofexternal risk and their ability to communicate to citizens and their regional partners what path they choose.No longer is the region's economy affected by just what happens in the US or its monetary policy. Geopolitical risk,stagflation and a longer-term demographic shift in the West will combine with an emerging set of opportunities forGulf state investors and regional economies.*Karen E.

Dec 2022;"Risks multiply and threaten the global economy";"OPINIONThe world is in a dangerous situation. We face multiple, growing and increasingly serious risks, including highgrowth in inflation rates, the energy and food crisis or climate risk, although undoubtedly the most dangerouschallenges ahead in 2023 are the sustainability of global debt and the possibility of a geopolitical crisis erupting. Onall of them depends whether global GDP will grow by 2.8% in 2023 or a recession will occur without sufficient fiscalspace to resolve it.On the economic side, the most worrying of these dangers is debt. Its sustainability is deteriorating rapidly, in acontext in which Central Banks are seeking to control inflation at the cost of tightening monetary policy. Historicallylow rates and the sustained purchase of financial assets by the ECB or the Fed allowed debt levels to bemaintained, but the current rises have highlighted the imbalances accumulated in developed countries and certainemerging economies, which, added to the strength of the dollar, could materialize in a significant risk of default.The risk map also contemplates the persistence of the inflationary cycle. Inflation is running rampant around theworld, and together with economic slowdown and even recession in more than one territory, we are facing astagflationary situation. The complexity of stagflation lies in the enormous difficulty in tackling it: to curb inflation, themeasures to be adopted are aimed at curbing consumption, but in a scenario of economic stagnation, the actionstaken are aimed at increasing it.The measures are precisely the opposite in both cases. Therefore, the measures to tackle it would include laborflexibility, business taxation to encourage investment, regulation with full guarantees of investor protection,abundant, diversified and safe energy supply so that it is cheap, less rigid commercial distribution, among others.Faced with the inflationary situation, and the consequent impact on citizens' income, governments haveimplemented expansionary fiscal policies, which clash with the contractionary monetary policies of central banks.Government fiscal policy, especially in Europe, should not be expansionary, because of the negative effect it wouldhave on inflation, counteracting the efforts being made by central banks to raise interest rates. As for the latter, thetightening of monetary policy is necessary, but it also slows economic growth and increases the risk of recession.The global growth forecast for 2023 stands at 2.8%, but a slight downward correction could bring us to thethreshold of a global recession (defined as growth below 2%).In addition, the continued rise in energy prices is a threat to growth. The price increases for gas, coal and oil arecoupled with other supply-side problems, which are generating a price boom that is starting to be a cause forconcern. This is resulting in a slowdown of economies due to a decline in productive activities. The energy crisiscaused by the war in Ukraine has highlighted the lack of planning on the part of the States, and that it is absolutelynecessary to seek alternatives to the current model, formulating integrated policies at a global level to combatdisruptions in the energy framework.The dangers do not only come from the economic sphere. On the political front, there is growing concern about theoutbreak of a geopolitical crisis. On the one hand, the war between Russia and Ukraine looks set to drag on. Areturn to the policy of areas of influence around two large blocs would threaten the globalization process as it hasbeen shaped since the incorporation of China into the world production chain, leading to structural changes in theglobal economy.In Asia, dissension between China and Taiwan and the trade war between China and the United States areincreasing tension in the region. Furthermore, the zero COVID policy implemented by President Xi has deterioratedboth consumer confidence and external demand, accumulating uncertainty for the coming winter and redefining therole of Chinese industry in global supply chains. In addition, the mortgage crisis is deteriorating the outlook for thesector and the risk remains that the country could trigger a debt crisis that could spread throughout the financialsystem.And on the other side of the Pacific, for the first time in history, the five main Latin American economies will begoverned by the left, which must face a complex macroeconomic panorama, marked by slowing economic growth,with some countries even in recession, in addition to high inflation and rising unemployment, which is generatingunease and impatience among citizens, many of whom have moved from the middle class to poverty.Finally, the Middle East is always a hot spot in the world. In Iran, with mass protests putting increasing pressure onTehran, international conflicts serve the regime as a scapegoat domestically: it can slander the protesters byaccusing them of being foreign agents. A show of external force in the form of military aggression against itsregional archenemy, Saudi Arabia, is not ruled out.Stagflation is a term first used in 1965, by the then British minister Ian Mcleod. According to this minister, stagflationwould be a situation where both economic stagnation and high inflation are present.By economic stagnation, we mean the condition of minimum growth of production in a country's economy, and byinflation, we mean the rise in prices and a loss of purchasing power.Aurelio García del Barrio Director of the Global MBA with a specialization in Finance at the IEB."
