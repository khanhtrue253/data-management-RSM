## Description

A replica of web application that I built for SchoolTalent, to locate tutors and their (offline) operating area. Map is used to identify areas where more tutors need to be recruited, thus narrowing marketing resources. The actual website is hosted on AWS EC2 server with a domain that is only known internally.

The replica sampled the original data & anonymized sensitive data - functionality is otherwise the same.
